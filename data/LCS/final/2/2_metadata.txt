Abstract#==#Pinyin is the most widely used romanization scheme for Mandarin Chinese. We
consider the task of language identification in Pinyin-English codeswitched
texts, a task that is significant because of its application to codeswitched
text input. We create a codeswitched corpus by extracting and automatically
labeling existing Mandarin-English codeswitched corpora. On language
identification, we find that SVM produces the best result when using word-level
segmentation, achieving 99.3% F1 on a Weibo dataset, while a linear-chain CRF
produces the best result at the letter level, achieving 98.2% F1. We then pass
the output of our models to a system that converts Pinyin back to Chinese
characters to simulate codeswitched text input. Our method achieves the same
level of performance as an oracle system that has perfect knowledge of
token-level language identity. This result demonstrates that Pinyin
identification is not the bottleneck towards developing a Chinese-English
codeswitched Input Method Editor, and future work should focus on the
Pinyin-to-Chinese character conversion step.
