Abstract#==#We present an overview of the second shared task on language identification in
code-switched data. For the shared task, we had code-switched data from two
different language pairs: Modern Standard Arabic-Dialectal Arabic (MSA-DA) and
Spanish-English (SPA-ENG). We had a total of nine participating teams, with all
teams submitting a system for SPA-ENG and four submitting for MSA-DA. Through
evaluation, we found that once again language identification is more difficult
for the language pair that is more closely related. We also found that this
year's systems performed better overall than the systems from the previous
shared task indicating overall progress in the state of the art for this task.
