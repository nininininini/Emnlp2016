Abstract#==#Language identification systems suffer when working with short texts or in
domains with unconventional spelling, such as Twitter or other social media.
These challenges are explored in a shared task for Language Identification in
Code-Switched Data (LICS 2016). We apply a hierarchical neural model to this
task, learning character and contextualized word-level representations to make
word-level language predictions. This approach performs well on both the 2014
and 2016 versions of the shared task.
