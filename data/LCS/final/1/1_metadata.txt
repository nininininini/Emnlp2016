Abstract#==#One of the benefits of language identification that is particularly relevant
for code-switching (CS) research is that it permits insight into how the
languages are mixed (i.e., the level of integration of the languages). The aim
of this paper is to quantify and visualize the nature of the integration of
languages in CS documents using simple language-independent metrics that can be
adopted by linguists. In our contribution, we (a) make a linguistic case for
classifying CS types according to how the languages are integrated; (b)
describe our language identification system; (c) introduce an Integration-index
(I-index) derived from HMM transition probabilities; (d) employ methods for
visualizing integration via a language signature (or switching profile); and
(e) illustrate the utility of our simple metrics for linguists as applied to
Spanish-English texts of different switching profiles.
