Abstract#==#Code-mixing is a prevalent phenomenon in modern day communication. Though
several systems enjoy success in identifying a single language, identifying
languages of words in code-mixed texts is a herculean task, more so in a social
media context. This paper explores the English-Bengali code-mixing phenomenon
and presents algorithms capable of identifying the language of every word to a
reasonable accuracy in specific cases and the general case. We create and test
a predictor- corrector model, develop a new code-mixed corpus from Facebook
chat (made available for future research) and test and compare the efficiency
of various machine learning algorithms (J48, IBk, Random Forest). The paper
also seeks to remove the ambiguities in the token identification
process.
