Abstract#==#Multilingual users of social media sometimes use multiple languages during
conversation. Mixing multiple languages in content is known as code-mixing. We
annotate a subset of a trilingual code-mixed corpus (Barman et al., 2014) with
part-of-speech (POS) tags. We investigate two state-of-the-art POS tag-
ging techniques for code-mixed content and combine the features of the two
systems to build a better POS tagger. Furthermore, we investigate the use of a
joint model which performs language identification (LID) and part-of-speech
(POS) tagging simultaneously.
