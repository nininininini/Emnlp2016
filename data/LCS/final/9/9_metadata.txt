Abstract#==#We address the problem of Part of Speech tagging (POS) in the context of
linguistic code switching (CS). CS is the phenomenon where a speaker switches
between two languages or variants of the same language within or across
utterances, known as intra-sentential or inter-sentential CS, respectively.
Processing CS data is especially challenging in intra-sentential data given
state of the art monolingual NLP technology since such technology is geared
toward the processing of one language at a time. In this paper we explore
multiple strategies of applying state of the art POS taggers to CS data. We
investigate the landscape in two CS language pairs,    
Spanish-English and Modern Standard Arabic and Arabic dialects. We compare the
use of two POS taggers vs. a unified tagger trained on CS data. Our results
show that applying the ML framework using two state of the art POS taggers
achieves better performance compared to all other approaches that we adopt in
our study.
