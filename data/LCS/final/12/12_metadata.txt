Abstract#==#Codeswitching is a very common behavior among Swahili speakers, but of the
little computational work done on Swahili, none has focused on codeswitching.
This paper addresses two tasks relating to Swahili-English codeswitching:
word-level language identification and prediction of codeswitch points. Our
two-step model achieves high accuracy at labeling the language of words using a
simple feature set combined with language scores on the adjacent words. This
system is used to label a large Swahili-English internet corpus, which is in
turn used to train a model for predicting codeswitch points.
