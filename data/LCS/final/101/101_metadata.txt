Abstract#==#Codeswitching is a widely observed phenomenon among bilingual speakers.
By combining subword information enriched word vectors with linear-chain
Conditional Random Field, we develop a supervised machine learning model that
identifies languages in a English-Spanish codeswitched tweets. Our
computational method achieves a tweet-level weighted F1 of 0.83 and a
token-level accuracy of 0.949 without using any external resource. The result
demonstrates that named entity recognition remains a challenge in codeswitched
texts and warrants further work.
