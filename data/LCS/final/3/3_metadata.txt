Abstract#==#A common step in the processing of any text is the part-of-speech tagging of
the input text. In this paper, we present an approach to tackle code-mixed text
from three different languages Bengali, Hindi, and Tamil, apart from  English.
Our system uses Conditional Random Field, a sequence learning method, which is
useful to capture patterns of sequences containing code switching to tag each
word with accurate part-of-speech information. We have used various
pre-processing and post-processing modules to improve the performance of our
system. The results were satisfactory, with a highest of 75.22% accuracy in
Bengali-English mixed data. The methodology that we employed in the task can be
used for any resource poor language. We adapted standard learning approaches
that work well with scarce data. We have also ensured that the system is
portable to different platforms and languages and can be deployed for real-time
analysis.
