Abstract#==#This paper describes the HHU-UH-G system submitted to the EMNLP 2016 Second
Workshop on Computational Approaches to Code Switching. Our system ranked first
place for Arabic (MSA-Egyptian) with an F1-score of 0.83 and second place for
Spanish-English with an F1-score of 0.90. The HHU-UH-G system introduces a
novel unified neural network architecture for language identification in
code-switched tweets for both Spanish English and MSA-Egyptian dialect. The
system makes use of word and character level representations to identify
code-switching. For the MSA-Egyptian dialect the system does not rely on any
kind of language-specific knowledge or linguistic resources such as, Part Of
Speech (POS) taggers, morphological analyzers, gazetteers or word lists to
obtain state-of-the-art performance.
