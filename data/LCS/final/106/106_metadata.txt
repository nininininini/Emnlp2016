Abstract#==#Half of the world's population is estimated to be at least bilingual. Due to
this fact many people use multiple languages interchangeably for effective
communication. At the Second Workshop on Computational Approaches to Code
Switching, we are presented with a task to label codeswitched, Spanish-English
(ES-EN) and Modern Standard Arabic-Dialect Arabic (MSA-DA), tweets. We built a
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based system using well-rounded features to
capture not only the two languages but also the other classes. On the
Spanish-English(ES-EN) classification task, we obtained weighted F1-score of
0.88 on the tweet level and an accuracy of 96.5% on the token level. On the
MSA-DA classification task, our system managed to obtain F1-score of 0.66 on
tweet level and overall token level accuracy of 74.7%.
