Abstract#==#Automatic simplification of clinical notes continues to be an
  important challenge for NLP systems. A frequent obstacle to
  developing more robust NLP systems for the clinical domain
  is the lack of annotated training data. This study investigates
  unsupervised techniques for one key aspect of medical text simplification,
  viz.~the expansion   and disambiguation of acronyms and abbreviations.
  Our approach combines statistical machine translation with
  document-context neural language models for the disambiguation of
  multi-sense terms.  In addition we investigate the use of mismatched
  training data and self-training. These techniques are evaluated on
  nursing progress notes and obtain a disambiguation accuracy of 71.6%
  without any manual annotation effort.
