Abstract#==#Automated citation analysis (ACA) can be important for many applications
including author ranking and literature based information retrieval,
extraction, summarization and question answering. In this study, we developed a
new compositional attention network (CAN) model to integrate local and global
attention representations with a hierarchical attention mechanism. Training on
a new benchmark corpus we built, our evaluation shows that the CAN model
performs consistently well on both citation classification and sentiment
analysis tasks.
