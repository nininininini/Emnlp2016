Abstract#==#Motivated by the need to automate medical information extraction from free-text
radiological reports, we present a bi-directional long short-term memory
(BiLSTM) neural network architecture for modelling radiological language. The
model has been used to address two NLP tasks: medical named-entity recognition
(NER) and negation detection. We investigate whether learning several types of
word embeddings improves BiLSTM's performance on those tasks. Using a large
dataset of chest x-ray reports, we compare the proposed model to a baseline
dictionary-based NER system and a negation detection system that leverages the
hand-crafted rules of the NegEx algorithm and the grammatical relations
obtained from the Stanford Dependency Parser. Compared to these more
traditional rule-based systems, we argue that BiLSTM offers a strong
alternative for both our tasks.
