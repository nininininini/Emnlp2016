Abstract#==#Drug name recognition (DNR) is an essential step in the Pharmacovigilance (PV)
pipeline. DNR aims to find drug name mentions in unstructured biomedical texts
and classify them into predefined categories. State-of-the-art DNR approaches
heavily rely on hand-crafted features and domain-specific resources which are
difficult to collect and tune. For this reason, this paper investigates the
effectiveness of contemporary recurrent neural architectures - the Elman and
Jordan networks and the bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding - at performing
DNR straight from the text. The experimental results achieved on the
authoritative SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 benchmarks show that the bidirectional
LSTM-CRF ranks closely to highly-dedicated, hand-crafted systems.
