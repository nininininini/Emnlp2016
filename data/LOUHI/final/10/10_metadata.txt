Abstract#==#Estimation of the semantic relatedness between biomedical concepts has utility
for many informatics applications. Automated methods fall into two broad
categories: methods based on distributional statistics drawn from text corpora,
and methods based on the structure of existing knowledge resources. In the
former case, taxonomic structure is disregarded. In the latter, semantically
relevant empirical information is not considered. In this paper, we present a
method that retrofits the context vector representation of MeSH terms by using
additional linkage information from UMLS/MeSH hierarchy such that linked
concepts have similar vector representations. We evaluated the method relative
to previously published physician and coder's ratings on sets of MeSH terms.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the retrofitted word vector measures
obtain a higher correlation with physician judgments. The results also
demonstrate a clear improvement on the correlation with experts' ratings from
the retrofitted vector representation in comparison to the vector
representation without retrofitting.
