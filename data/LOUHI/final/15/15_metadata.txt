Abstract#==#In this paper we present a simple yet effective approach to automatic OCR error
detection and correction on a corpus of French clinical reports of variable OCR
quality within the domain of foetopathology. While traditional OCR error
detection and correction systems rely heavily on external information such as
domain-specific lexicons, OCR process information or manually corrected
training material, these are not always available given the constraints placed
on using medical corpora. We therefore propose a novel method that only needs a
representative corpus of acceptable OCR quality in order to train models. Our
method uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model sequential information on
character level for a given medical text corpus. By inserting noise during the
training process we can simultaneously learn the underlying (character-level)
language model and as well as learning to detect and eliminate random noise
from the textual input. The resulting models are robust to the variability of
OCR quality but do not require additional, external information such as
lexicons. 
 We compare two different ways of injecting noise into the training process and
evaluate our models on a manually corrected data set. We find that the best
performing system achieves a 73% accuracy.
