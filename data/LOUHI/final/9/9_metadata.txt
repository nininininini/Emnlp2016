Abstract#==#Performing systematic reviews is a critical yet manual, labor-intensive step in
evidence-based medicine. Automating systematic reviews is an active area of
research, requiring innovations in machine learning and computational
linguistics. We examine how coreference resolution can aid in identifying the
arms of a study, an often overlooked piece of information needed to synthesize
the results in a systematic review. A classification model that performs better
with the coreference features supports the intuition that coreference is able
to capture the discourse salience of arms. We note that control arms do not
benefit as much from these features.
