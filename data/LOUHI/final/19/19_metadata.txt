Abstract#==#ICD-10 coding of death certificates has received renewed attention recently
with the organization of the CLEF eHealth 2016 clinical information extraction
task (CLEF eHealth 2016 Task 2).  This task has been addressed either with
dictionary projection methods or with supervised machine learning methods, but
none of the participants have tried to design hybrid methods to process these
data.
The goal of the present paper is to explore such hybrid methods.
It proposes several hybrid methods which outperform both plain dictionary
projection and supervised machine learning on the training set.
On the official test set, it obtains an F-measure of 0.8586 which is 1pt above
the best published results so far on this corpus (p<0.0001).  Moreover, it does
so with no manual dictionary tuning, and thus has potential for generalization
to other languages with little effort.
