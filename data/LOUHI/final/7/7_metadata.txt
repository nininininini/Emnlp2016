Abstract#==#Online health communities and support groups are a valuable source of
information for users suffering from a physical or mental illness. Users turn
to these forums for moral support or advice on specific conditions, symptoms,
or side effects of medications. This paper describes and studies the linguistic
patterns of a community of support forum users over time focused on the used of
anxious related words. We introduce a methodology to identify groups of
individuals exhibiting linguistic patterns associated with anxiety and the
correlations between this linguistic pattern and other word usage. We find some
evidence that participation in these groups does yield positive effects on
their users by reducing the frequency of anxious related word used over time.
