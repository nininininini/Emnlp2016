Abstract#==#Identifying relevant studies from the entire scientific literature is an
important task in biomedical research. Past efforts have incorporated
semantically recognized biological entities and medical ontologies into
biomedical literature search. However, semantic relations are largely
overlooked by biomedical search engines. In this work, we aim to discover
synonymous biomedical semantic relations between entities and explore their
uses in query (semantics) understanding for improved retrieval performance.
Specifically, we discover synonymous semantic relations from PubMed queries and
apply them to query expansion and specification. In these two real-world
scenarios, better PubMed retrieval effectiveness, in terms of recall and
precision, can be achieved, demonstrating the utility of our proposed approach.
