Abstract#==#Social media sites such as microblogs and discussion board forums have the
potential to be rich source of information about human health. Going beyond
simple keyword search and harnessing the data for insights that can benefit
public health presents both opportunities and challenges to natural language
pro- cessing (NLP). In this talk I survey the progress made using NLP methods,
e.g. for adverse drug reaction profiling, flu surveillance and the study of
depressive disorders. I will then look at the technical challenges in
understanding such messages, in particular how NLP can automatically
encode/normalise laymen’s lan- guage to the formal terminologies of
healthcare professionals. To this end I present state of the art results from
our recent work on using deep neural networks to de-conflate word senses as
well as ‘translating’ from social media messages to SNOMED-CT. I will
finish by briefly reflecting on the practical and ethical challenges that lie
ahead.
