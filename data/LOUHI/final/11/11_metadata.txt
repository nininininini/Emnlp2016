Abstract#==#Assisted text input techniques can save time and effort and improve text
quality.
In this paper, we investigate how grounded and conditional extensions to
standard neural language models can bring improvements in the tasks of word
prediction and completion.
These extensions incorporate a structured knowledge base and numerical values
from the text into the context used to predict the next word.
Our automated evaluation on a clinical dataset shows extended models
significantly outperform standard models.
Our best system uses both conditioning and grounding, because of their
orthogonal benefits.
For word prediction with a list of 5 suggestions, it improves recall from
25.03% to 71.28%  and for word completion it improves keystroke savings from
34.35% to 44.81%, where theoretical bound for this dataset is 58.78%.
We also perform a qualitative investigation of how models with lower perplexity
occasionally fare better at the tasks. We found that at test time numbers have
more influence on the document level than on individual word probabilities.
