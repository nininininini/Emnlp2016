Abstract#==#Efficient methods for storing and querying are critical for scaling high-order
m-gram language models to large corpora. We propose a language model based on
compressed suffix trees, a representation that is highly compact and can be
easily held in memory, while supporting queries needed in computing language
model probabilities on-the-fly. We present several optimizations which improve
query runtimes up to 2500x, despite only incurring a modest increase in
construction time and memory usage. For large corpora and high Markov orders,
our method is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art KenLM package. It
imposes much lower memory requirements, often by orders of magnitude, and has
runtimes that are either similar (for training) or comparable (for querying).
