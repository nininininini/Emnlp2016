Abstract#==#We release Galactic Dependencies 1.0—a large set of synthetic languages not
found on Earth, but annotated in Universal Dependencies format. This new
resource aims to pro-vide training and development data for NLP methods that
aim to adapt to unfamiliar languages. Each synthetic treebank is produced from
a real treebank by stochastically permuting the dependents of nouns and/or
verbs to match the word order of other real languages. We discuss the
usefulness, realism, parsability, perplexity, and diversity of the synthetic
languages. As a simple demonstration of the use of Galactic Dependencies, we
consider single-source transfer, which attempts to parse a real target language
using a parser trained on a “nearby” source language. We find that
including synthetic source languages somewhat increases the diversity of the
source pool, which significantly improves results for most target languages.
