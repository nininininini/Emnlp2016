Abstract#==#We suggest a compositional vector representation of parse trees that relies on
a recursive combination of recurrent-neural network encoders. To demonstrate
its effectiveness, we use the representation as the backbone of a greedy,
bottom-up dependency parser, achieving very strong accuracies for English and
Chinese, without relying on external word embeddings. The parser’s 
implementation is available for download at the first author’s webpage.
