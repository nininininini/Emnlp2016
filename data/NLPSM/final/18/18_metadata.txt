Abstract#==#Understanding expression of emotions in support forums has great value and NLP
methods are key to automating this. Many approaches use subjective categories
which are more fine-grained than a straightforward polarity-based spectrum.
However, the definition of such categories is non-trivial, and we argue for a
need to incorporate communicative elements even beyond subjectivity. To support
our position, we report experiments on a sentiment-labelled corpus of posts
from a medical support forum. We argue that a more fine-grained approach to
text analysis important, and also simultaneously recognising the social
function behind affective expressions enables a more accurate and valuable
level of understanding.
