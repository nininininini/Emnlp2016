Abstract#==#This paper investigates the problem of identifying participants in online
discussions whose contribution can be considered sensible. Sensibleness of a
participant can be indicative of the influence a participant may have on the
course/outcome of the discussion, as well as other participants in terms of
persuading them towards his/her stance. The proposed sensibleness model uses
features based on participants' contribution and the discussion domain to
achieve an F1-score of 0.89 \& 0.78 for Wikipedia: Articles for Deletion and
4forums.com discussions respectively.
