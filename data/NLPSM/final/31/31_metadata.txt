Abstract#==#In this paper we present a filter for identifying posts from eyewitnesses to
various event types on Twitter, including shootings, police activity, and
protests. The filter combines sociolinguistic markers and targeted language
content with straightforward keywords and regular expressions to yield good
accuracy in the returned tweets. Once a set of eyewitness posts in a given
semantic context has been produced by the filter, eyewitness events can
subsequently be identified by enriching the data with additional geolocation
information and then applying a spatio-temporal clustering. By applying these
steps we can extract a complete picture of the event as it occurs in real-time,
sourced entirely from social media.
