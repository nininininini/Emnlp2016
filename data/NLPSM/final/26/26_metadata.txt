Abstract#==#For social media analysts or social scientists interested in better
understanding an audience or demographic cohort, being able to group social
media content by demographic characteristics is a useful mechanism to organise
data. Social roles are one particular demographic characteristic,
which includes work, recreational, community and familial roles.
In our work, we look at the task of detecting social roles from English Twitter
profiles.
We create a new annotated dataset for this task. 
The dataset includes approximately 1,000
Twitter profiles annotated with social roles. 
We also describe a machine learning approach for detecting social roles from
Twitter profiles, 
which can act as a strong baseline for this dataset.
Finally, we release a set of word clusters obtained in an unsupervised manner 
from Twitter profiles. These clusters may be useful for other natural language 
processing tasks in social media.
