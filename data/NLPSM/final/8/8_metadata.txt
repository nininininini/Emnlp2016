Abstract#==#Depression is a major threat to public health, accounting for almost 12% of all
disabilities and claiming the life of one out of every five patients suffering
from it. Since depression is often signaled by decreasing social interaction,
we explored how analysis of online health forums may help identify such
episodes. We collected posts and replies from users of several forums on
healthboards.com and analyzed changes in their use of language and activity
levels over time. We found revealing phrases that are associated with final
posts in a Depression forum (e.g. cut myself), and that users of a Depression
forum use many fewer social words as compared to users of related forums like
Relationship Health or Brain/Nervous System Disorder. We explored building
models based on these findings, and achieved 94.05 F1 for detecting users who
will withdraw from a Depression forum by the end of a 1-year observation
period.
