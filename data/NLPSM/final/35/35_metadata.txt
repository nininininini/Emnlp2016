Abstract#==#Identifying witness accounts is important for rumor debunking, crises
management, and basically any task that involves on the ground eyes. The
prevalence of social media has provided citizen journalism scale and eye
witnesses prominence.  However, the amount of noise on social media also makes
it likely that witness accounts get buried too deep in the noise and are never
discovered. 
In this paper, we explore automatic witness identification in Twitter during
emergency events. We attempt to create a generalizeable system that not only
detects witness reports for unseen events, but also on true out-of-sample
``real time streaming set" that may or may not have witness accounts. 
We attempt to detect the presence or surge of witness accounts, which is the
first step in developing a model for detecting crisis-related events.
We collect and annotate witness tweets for different types of events
(earthquake, car accident, fire, cyclone, etc.) explore the related features
and build a classifier to identify witness tweets in real time. Our system is
able to significantly outperform prior methods with an average accuracy of
89.7% on previously unseen events.
