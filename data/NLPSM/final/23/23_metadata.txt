Abstract#==#Many social media platforms offer a mechanism for readers to react to comments,
both positively and negatively, which in aggregate can be thought of as
community endorsement. This paper addresses the problem of predicting community
endorsement in online discussions, leveraging both the participant response
structure and the text of the comment. The different types of features are
integrated in a neural network that uses a novel architecture
to learn latent modes of discussion structure that perform as well as deep
neural networks but are more interpretable. In addition, the latent modes can
be used to weight text features thereby improving prediction accuracy.
