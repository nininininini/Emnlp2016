Abstract#==#Work on cross document coreference resolution (CDCR) has primarily focused on
news articles,
with little to no work for social media. Yet social media may be particularly 
challenging since short messages provide little context,
and informal names are pervasive.
We introduce a new Twitter corpus that contains entity annotations for entity
clusters that supports CDCR.
Our corpus draws from Twitter data surrounding the 2013 Grammy music awards
ceremony, providing a large set 
of annotated tweets focusing on a single event. 
To establish a baseline we evaluate two CDCR systems and consider the
performance impact
of each system component. Furthermore, we augment one system to include
temporal information, which can be helpful when documents (such as tweets)
arrive
in a specific order.
Finally, we include annotations linking the entities to a knowledge base to
support entity linking.
