Abstract#==#Previous work on opinion mining and sentiment analysis mainly concerns product,
movie, or literature reviews; few applied this technique to analyze the
publicity of person. We present a novel document modeling method that utilizes
embeddings of emotion keywords to perform reader's emotion classification, and
calculates a publicity score that serves as a quantifiable measure for the
publicity of a person of interest. Experiments are conducted on two Chinese
corpora that in total consists of over forty thousand users' emotional response
after reading news articles. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can
outperform state-of-the-art reader-emotion classification methods, and provide
a substantial ground for publicity score estimation for candidates of political
elections. We believe it is a promising direction for mining the publicity of a
person from online social and news media that can be useful for propaganda and
other purposes.
