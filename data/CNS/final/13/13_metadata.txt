Abstract#==#Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is an important research topic in data
mining and information retrieval and has been explored for many years. 
Most of the studies have approached the problem from the event tracking point
of view. We argue that the definition of stories as events is not reflecting
the full picture. 
In this work we propose a story tracking method built on crowd-tagging in
social media, where news articles are labeled with hashtags in real-time.
The social tags act as rich meta-data for news articles, with the advantage
that, if carefully employed, they can capture emerging concepts and address
concept drift in a story. 
We present an approach for employing social tags for the purpose of story
detection and tracking and show initial empirical results.
We compare our method to classic keyword query retrieval and discuss an example
of story tracking over time.
