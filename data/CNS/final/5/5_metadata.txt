Abstract#==#This paper illustrates a proposal for the development of an annotation scheme
and a corpus for storyline extraction and evaluation from large collections of
documents clustered around a topic. The scheme extends existing annotation
efforts for event coreference and temporal processing, introducing additional
layers and addressing shortcomings. We also show how a storyline can be derived
from the annotated data.
