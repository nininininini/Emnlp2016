Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate the distribution of narrative schemas (Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2009) throughout different document categories and how the
structure of narrative schemas is conditioned by document category, the
converse of the relationship explored in Simonson and Davis (2015). We evaluate
cross-category narrative differences by assessing the predictability of verbs
in each category and the salience of arguments to events that narrative schemas
highlight. For the former, we use the narrative cloze task employed in previous
work on schemas. For the latter, we introduce a task that employs narrative
schemas called narrative argument salience through entities annotated, or
NASTEA. We compare the schemas induced from the entire corpus to those from the
subcorpora for each topic using these two types of evaluation. Results of each
evaluation vary by each topical subcorpus, in some cases showing improvement,
but the NASTEA task additionally reveals that some the documents within some
topics are significantly more rigid in their narrative structure, instantiating
a limited number of schemas in a highly predictable fashion.
