Abstract#==#Abstract: Two contrasting paradigms for structuring news events and storylines
are identified and described: the automated paradigm and the manual paradigm. A
specific manual news structuring system is described, and the high level
results of three reporting experiments conducted using the system are
presented. In light of these results I then compare automated and manual
approaches and argue that they are complementary. A proposal for integrating
automated and manual techniques within a structured news ecosystem is
presented, and recommendations for integrated approaches are provided.
