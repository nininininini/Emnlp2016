Abstract#==#The style of narrative news affects how it
is interpreted and received by readers. Two
key stylistic characteristics of narrative text
are point of view and diegesis: respectively,
whether the narrative recounts events person-
ally or impersonally, and whether the narrator
is involved in the events of the story. Although
central to the interpretation and reception of
news, and of narratives more generally, there
has been no prior work on automatically iden-
tifying these two characteristics in text. We
develop automatic classifiers for point of view
and diegesis, and compare the performance of
different feature sets for both. We built a gold-
standard corpus where we double-annotated
to substantial agreement (Îº > 0.59) 270 En-
glish novels for point of view and diegesis. As
might be expected, personal pronouns com-
prise the best features for point of view clas-
sification, achieving an average F1 of 0.928.
For diegesis, the best features were personal
pronouns and the occurrences of first person
pronouns in the argument of verbs, achieving
an average F1 of 0.898. We apply the clas-
sifier to nearly 40,000 news texts across five
different corpora comprising multiple genres
(including newswire, opinion, blog posts, and
scientific press releases), and show that the
point of view and diegesis correlates largely as
expected with the nominal genre of the texts.
We release the training data and the classifier
for use by the community.
