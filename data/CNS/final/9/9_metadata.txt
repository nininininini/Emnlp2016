Abstract#==#News events and social media are composed of evolving storylines, which capture
public attention for a limited period of time. Identifying storylines requires
integrating temporal and linguistic information, and prior work takes a largely
heuristic approach. We present a novel online non-parametric Bayesian framework
for storyline detection, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant
Process (dd-CRP). To ensure efficient linear-time inference, we employ a
fixed-lag Gibbs sampling procedure, which is novel for the dd-CRP. We evaluate
on the TREC Twitter Timeline Generation (TTG), obtaining encouraging results:
despite using a weak baseline retrieval model, the dd-CRP story clustering
method is competitive with the best entries in the 2014 TTG task.
