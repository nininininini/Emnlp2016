Abstract#==#The vast availability of textual data on social media has led to an interest in
algorithms to predict user attributes such as gender based on the user's
writing. These methods              are valuable for social science research as well
as
targeted advertising and profiling, but also compromise the privacy of users
who may not realize that their personal idiolects can give away their
demographic identities. Can we automatically modify a text so that the author
is classified as a certain target gender, under limited knowledge of the
classifier, while preserving the text's fluency and meaning? We present a
simple model to modify a text using lexical substitution, show empirical
results with Twitter and Yelp, and outline ideas for extensions.
