Abstract#==#It has been claimed that people are more likely to be influenced by those who
are similar to them than those who are not. In this paper, we test this
hypothesis by measuring the impact of author traits on the detection of
influence. The traits we explore are age, gender, religion, and political
party. We create a single classifier to detect the author traits of each
individual. We then use the personal traits predicted by this classifier to
predict the influence of contributors in a Wikipedia Talk Page corpus. Our
research shows that the influencer tends to have the same traits as the
majority of people in the conversation. Furthermore, we show that this is more
pronounced when considering the personal traits most relevant to the
conversation. Our research thus provides evidence for the theory of social
proof.
