Abstract#==#Understanding the ways in which users interact with different online
communities is crucial to social network analysis and community maintenance. We
present an unsupervised neural model to learn linguistic descriptors for a
user's behavior over time within an online community. We show that the
descriptors learned by our model capture the functional roles that users occupy
in communities, in contrast to those learned via a standard topic-modeling
algorithm, which simply reflect topical content. Experiments on the social
media forum Reddit show how the model can provide interpretable insights into
user behavior. Our model uncovers linguistic differences that correlate with
user activity levels and community clustering.
