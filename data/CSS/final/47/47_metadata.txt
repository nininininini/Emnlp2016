Abstract#==#Hate speech in the form of racism and sexism is commonplace on the internet
(Waseem and Hovy, 2016). For this reason, there has been both an academic and
an industry interest in detection of hate speech. The volume of data to be
reviewed for creating data sets encour- ages a use of crowd sourcing for the
annotation efforts.
In this paper, we provide an examination of the influence of annotator
knowledge of hate speech on classification models by comparing classification
results obtained from training on expert and amateur annotations. We provide an
evaluation on our own data set and run our models on the data set released by
Waseem and Hovy (2016).
We find that amateur annotators are more likely than expert annotators to label
items as hate speech, and that systems trained on ex- pert annotations
outperform systems trained on amateur annotations.
