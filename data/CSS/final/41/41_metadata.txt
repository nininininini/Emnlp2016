Abstract#==#We present a corpus for protest event mining that combines token-level
annotation with the event schema and ontology of entities and events from
protest research in the social sciences. The dataset uses newswire reports from
the English Gigaword corpus. The token-level annotation is inspired by
annotation standards for event extraction, in particular that of the Automated
Content Extraction 2005 corpus (Walker et al., 2006). Domain experts perform
the entire annotation task. We report competitive intercoder agreement results.
