Abstract#==#Informal genres such as tweets provide large quantities of data in real-time,
which can be exploited to obtain, through ranking and classification, a
succinct summary of the events that occurred. Previous work on tweet ranking
and classification mainly focused on salience and social network features or
rely on web documents such as online news articles. In this paper, we exploit
language independent journalism and content based features to identify news
from tweets. We propose a novel newsworthiness classifier trained through
active learning and investigate human assessment and automatic methods to
encode it on both the tweet and trending topic levels. Our findings show that
content and journalism based features proved to be effective for ranking and
classifying content on Twitter.
