Abstract#==#The lack of demographic information available when conducting passive analysis
of social media content can make it difficult to compare results to traditional
survey results. We present Demographer, a tool that predicts gender from names,
using name lists and a classifier with simple character-level features. By
relying only on a name, our tool can make predictions even without extensive
user-authored content. We compare Demographer to other available tools and
discuss differences in performance. In particular, we show that Demographer
performs well on Twitter data, making it useful for simple and rapid social
media demographic inference.
