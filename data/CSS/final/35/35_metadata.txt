Abstract#==#There have been recent efforts to use social media to estimate demographic 
characteristics, such as age, gender or income, but there has been little work
on 
investigating the effect of data acquisition methods on producing these
estimates. In this paper, we compare four different Twitter data acquisition
methods and 
explore their effects on the prediction of one particular demographic
characteristic: occupation (or profession). 
We present a comparative analysis of the four data acquisition methods in the
context of estimating occupation statistics for Australia.  Our results show
that the social network-based data collection method seems to perform the best.
However, we note that each different data collection approach has its own 
benefits and limitations.
