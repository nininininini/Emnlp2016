Abstract#==#Social scientists who do not have specialized natural language processing
training often use a unigram bag-of-words (BOW) representation when analyzing
text corpora. We offer a new phrase-based method, NPFST, for enriching a
unigram BOW. NPFST uses a part-of-speech tagger and a finite state transducer
to extract multiword phrases to be added to a unigram BOW. We compare NPFST to
both n-gram and parsing methods in terms of yield, recall, and efficiency. We
then demonstrate
how to use NPFST for exploratory analyses; it performs well, without
configuration, on many different kinds of English text. Finally, we present a
case study using NPFST to analyze a new corpus of U.S. congressional bills.
