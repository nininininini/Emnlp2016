Abstract#==#Computational social science is, at its core, a blending of disciplines - the
best of human experience, judgement, and anecdotal case studies fused with
novel computational methods to extract subtle patterns from immense data.
Jointly leveraging such diverse approaches effectively is decidedly nontrivial,
but with tremendous potential benefits. We provide frank assessments from our
work bridging the computational linguistics and psychology communities during a
range of short and long-term engagements, in the hope that these assessments
might provide a foundation upon which those embarking on novel computational
social science projects might structure their interactions.
