Abstract#==#Politicians often use Twitter to express their beliefs, stances on current
political issues, and reactions concerning national and international events.
Since politicians are scrutinized for what they choose or neglect to say, they
craft their statements carefully. Thus despite the limited length of tweets,
their content is highly indicative of a politician's stances. We present a
weakly supervised method for understanding the stances held by politicians, on
a wide array of issues, by analyzing how issues are framed in their tweets and
their temporal activity patterns. We combine these components into a global
model which collectively infers the most likely stance and agreement patterns.
