Abstract#==#We combine social theory and NLP methods
to classify English-speaking Twitter usersâ€™ online
social identity in profile descriptions. We
conduct two text classification experiments. In
Experiment 1 we use a 5-category online social
identity classification based on identity
and self-categorization theories. While we are
able to automatically classify two identity categories
(Relational and Occupational), automatic
classification of the other three identities
(Political, Ethnic/religious and Stigmatized) is
challenging. In Experiment 2 we test a merger
of such identities based on theoretical arguments.
We find that by combining these identities
we can improve the predictive performance
of the classifiers in the experiment. Our
study shows how social theory can be used to
guide NLP methods, and how such methods
provide input to revisit traditional social theory
that is strongly consolidated in offline settings.
