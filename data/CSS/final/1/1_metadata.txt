Abstract#==#Computational linguists have long relied on a distinction between semantic
similarity and semantic association to explain and evaluate what is being
learned by NLP models. In the present work, we take these same concepts and
explore how they apply to an entirely different question - how individuals
label other people. Leveraging survey data made public by NLP researchers, we
develop our own survey to connect semantic similarity and semantic association
to the process by which humans label other people. The result is a set of
insights applicable to how we think of semantic similarity as NLP researchers
and a new way of leveraging NLP models of semantic similarity and association
as researchers of social science.
