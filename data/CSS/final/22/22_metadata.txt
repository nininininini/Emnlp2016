Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel method for user profiling in social media that
makes use of geo-location information associated with social media posts to
avoid the need for self-reported data. These posts are combined with two
publicly available sources of demographic information to automatically create
data sets in which posts are labelled with socio-economic status. The data sets
are linked by identifying each user's `home location'. Analysis indicates that
the nature of the demographic information is an important factor in performance
of this approach.
