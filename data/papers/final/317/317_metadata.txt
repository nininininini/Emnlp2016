Abstract#==#One major deficiency of most semantic representation techniques is that they
usually model a word type as a single point in the semantic space, hence
conflating all the meanings that the word can have.  Addressing this issue by
learning  distinct  representations  for  individual meanings of words has been
the subject of several research studies in the past few years. However, the
generated sense representations are either not linked to any sense inventory or
are unreliable for infrequent word senses. We propose  a  technique  that 
tackles  these                          problems              by        de-conflating 
the            
representations  of
words
based on the deep knowledge that can be derived from a semantic network.  Our
approach provides multiple advantages in comparison to the previous approaches,
including its  high  coverage  and  the  ability  to  generate accurate 
representations  even  for  infrequent word senses.  We carry out evaluations
on six datasets across two semantic similarity tasks and report
state-of-the-art results on most of them.
