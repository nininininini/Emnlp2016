Abstract#==#Embedding knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces has recently attracted
increasing interest. Most existing methods perform the embedding task using
only fact triples. Logical rules, although containing rich background
information, have not been well studied in this task. This paper proposes a
novel method of jointly embedding knowledge graphs and logical rules. The key
idea is to represent and model triples and rules in a unified framework.
Specifically, triples are represented as atomic formulae and modeled by the
translation assumption, while rules represented as complex formulae and modeled
by t-norm fuzzy logics. Embedding then amounts to minimizing a global loss over
both atomic and complex formulae. In this manner, we learn embeddings
compatible not only with triples but also with rules, which will certainly be
more predictive for knowledge acquisition and inference. We evaluate our method
with link prediction and triple classification tasks. Experimental results show
that joint embedding brings significant and consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, it enhances the prediction of new facts
which cannot even be directly inferred by pure logical inference, demonstrating
the capability of our method to learn more predictive embeddings.
