Abstract#==#We present an approach to simultaneously perform semantic segmentation and
prepositional phrase attachment resolution for captioned images.  The
motivation for this work comes from the fact that some ambiguities in language
simply cannot be resolved without simultaneously reasoning about an associated
image. If we consider the sentence "I shot an elephant in my pajamas", looking
at the language alone (and not reasoning about common sense), it is unclear if
it is the person or the elephant that is wearing the pajamas or both. Our
approach involves producing a diverse set of plausible hypotheses for both
semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution that are
then jointly re-ranked to select the most consistent pair. We show that our
semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution modules
have complementary strengths, and that joint reasoning produces more accurate
results than any module operating in isolation. We also show that multiple
hypotheses are crucial to improved multiple-module reasoning. Our vision and
language approach significantly outperforms the Stanford Parser by 17.91%
(28.69% relative) in one experiment, and by 12.83% (25.28% relative) in
another. We also make small improvements over a vision system (DeepLab-CRF).
