Abstract#==#We present a study on two key characteristics of human syntactic annotations:
anchoring and agreement. Anchoring is a well known cognitive bias in 
human decision making, where judgments are drawn towards pre-existing values. 
We study the influence of anchoring on a standard approach to creation of 
syntactic resources where syntactic annotations are obtained via human 
editing of tagger and parser output. Our experiments demonstrate a clear 
anchoring effect and reveal unwanted consequences, including 
overestimation of parsing performance and lower quality of 
annotations in comparison with human-based annotations. 
Using sentences from the Penn Treebank WSJ, we also report 
systematically obtained inter-annotator agreement estimates for English 
dependency parsing. Our agreement results control for parser bias, and are 
consequential in that they are on par with state of the art parsing 
performance for English newswire. We discuss the impact of our findings on
strategies for future annotation efforts and parser evaluations.
