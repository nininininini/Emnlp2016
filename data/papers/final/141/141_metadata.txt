Abstract#==#We propose a novel unsupervised word alignment method that uses a constraint
based on Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) parse trees to jointly unify two
directional models.
Previous agreement methods are not helpful for locating alignments with long
distances because they do not use any syntactic structures.
In contrast, the proposed method symmetrizes alignments in consideration of
their structural coherence by using the ITG constraint softly in the posterior
regularization framework (Ganchev et al., 2010).
The ITG constraint is also compatible with word alignments that are not covered
by ITG parse trees.
Hence, the proposed method is robust to ITG parse errors compared to other
alignment methods that directly use an ITG model.
Compared to the baseline agreement method (Ganchev et al., 2010), the
experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves
alignment performance regarding Japanese-English KFTT and BTEC corpus,
and machine translation performance on the Japanese-English IWSLT 2007 corpus.
