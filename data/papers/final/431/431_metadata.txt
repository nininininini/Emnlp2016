Abstract#==#Deep inference on a large-scale knowledge base (KB) need a mass of formulas,
but it is almost impossible to create all formulas manually.  Data-driven
methods have been proposed to mine formulas from KBs automatically, where
random sampling and approximate calculation are common techniques to handle big
data. Thereinto, Random Walk is the most suitable for knowledge graph data.
However, a pure random walk without goals has a poor efficiency of mining
useful formulas, and even introduces lots of noise which may mislead inference.
Although several heuristic rules have been proposed to direct random walks,
they do not work well due to the diversity of formulas. To this end, we propose
a novel goal-directed algorithm, which directs random walks by the specific
inference target at each step. The algorithm is more inclined to visit
beneficial structures to infer the target, so it can increase efficiency of
random walks and avoid noise simultaneously. In our experiments, we prove our
approach is high-efficiency and perform best on the KB link prediction task.
