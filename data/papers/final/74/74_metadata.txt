Abstract#==#In this work, we investigate the possibility of cross-website transfer learning
for tackling the cold-start problem. To address the cold-start issues commonly
present in a collaborative filtering (CF) system, most existing cross-domain CF
models require auxiliary rating data from another domain; nevertheless, under
the cross-website scenario, such data is often unobtainable. Therefore, we
propose the nearest-neighbor transfer matrix factorization (NT-MF) model, where
a topic model is applied to the unstructured user-generated content in the
source domain, and the similarity between users in the latent topic space is
utilized to guide the target-domain CF model. Specifically, the latent factors
of the nearest-neighbors are regarded as a set of pseudo observations, which
can be used to estimate the unknown parameters in the model. Improvement over
previous methods, especially for the cold-start users, is demonstrated with
experiments on a real-world cross-website dataset.
