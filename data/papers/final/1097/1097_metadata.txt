Abstract#==#We present Charagram embeddings, a simple approach for learning character-based
compositional models to embed textual sequences. A word or sentence is
represented using a character n-gram count vector, followed by a single
nonlinear transformation to yield a low-dimensional embedding. We use three
tasks for evaluation: word similarity, sentence similarity, and part-of-speech
tagging. We demonstrate that Charagram embeddings outperform more complex
architectures based on character-level recurrent and
convolutional neural networks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on
several similarity tasks.
