Abstract#==#Existing work on detecting deceptive reviews primarily focuses on feature
engineering and applies off-the-shelf supervised classification algorithms to
the problem. Then, one real challenge would be to manually recognize plentiful
ground truth spam review data for model building, which is rather difficult and
often requires domain expertise in practice. In this paper, we propose to
exploit the relatedness of multiple review spam detection tasks and readily
available unlabeled data to address the scarcity of labeled opinion spam data.
We first develop a multi-task learning method based on logistic regression
(MTL-LR), which can boost the learning for a task by sharing the knowledge
contained in the training signals of other related tasks. To leverage the
unlabeled data, we introduce a graph Laplacian regularizer into each base
model. We then propose a novel semi-supervised multi-task learning method via
Laplacian regularized logistic regression (SMTL-LLR) to further improve the
review spam detection performance. We also develop a stochastic alternating
method to cope with the optimization for SMTL-LLR. Experimental results on
real-world review data demonstrate the benefit of SMTL-LLR over several
well-established baseline methods.
