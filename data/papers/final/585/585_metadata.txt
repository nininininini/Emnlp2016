Abstract#==#We propose a neural-network based model for coordination boundary prediction.
The network is designed to incorporate two signals: the similarity between
conjuncts and the observation that replacing the whole coordination phrase with
a conjunct tends to produce a coherent sentences. The modeling makes use of
several LSTM networks. 
The model is trained solely on conjunction annotations in treebank, without
using external resources.
We show improvements on predicting coordination boundaries on the PTB compared
to two state-of-the-art parsers; as well as improvement over previous
coordination boundary prediction systems on the Genia corpus.
