Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the task of response selection for multi-turn
human-computer conversation. Previous approaches take word as a unit and view
context and response as sequences of words. This kind of approaches do not
explicitly take each utterance as a unit, therefore it is difficult to catch
utterance-level discourse information and dependencies. In this paper, we
propose a multi-view response selection model that integrates information from
two different views, i.e., word sequence view and utterance sequence view. We
jointly model the two views via deep neural networks. Experimental results on a
public corpus for context-sensitive response selection demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed multi-view model, which significantly outperforms
other single-view baselines.
