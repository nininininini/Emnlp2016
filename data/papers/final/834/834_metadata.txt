Abstract#==#Supervised stance classification, in such domains as Congressional debates and
online forums, has been a topic of interest in the past decade. Approaches have
evolved from text classification to structured output prediction, including
collective classification and sequence labeling. In this work, we investigate
collective classification of stances on Twitter, using hinge-loss Markov random
fields (HL-MRFs). Given the graph of all posts, users, and their relationships,
we constrain the predicted post labels and latent user labels to correspond
with the network structure. We focus on a weakly supervised setting, in which
only a small set of hashtags or phrases is labeled. Using our relational
approach, we are able to go beyond the stance-indicative patterns and harvest
more stance-indicative tweets, which can also be used to train any linear text
classifier when the network structure is not available or is costly.
