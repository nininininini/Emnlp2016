Abstract#==#Traditional automated essay scoring systems rely on carefully designed features
to evaluate and score essays. The performance of such systems is tightly bound
to the quality of the underlying features. However, it is laborious to manually
design the most informative features for such a system. In this paper, we
develop an approach based on recurrent neural networks to learn the relation
between an essay and its assigned score, without any feature engineering. We
explore several neural network models for the task of automated essay scoring
and perform some analysis to get some insights of the models. The results show
that our best system, which is based on long short-term memory networks,
outperforms a strong baseline by 5.6% in terms of quadratic weighted Kappa,
without requiring any feature engineering.
