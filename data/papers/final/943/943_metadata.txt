Abstract#==#This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online
communities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and
correlation with community reception of content. Style is characterized using
hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language models, while topic is
represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit
forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic,
even for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a
positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the
style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.
