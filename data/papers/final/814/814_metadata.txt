Abstract#==#Verb Phrase Ellipsis (VPE) is an anaphoric construction in which a verb phrase
has been elided. It occurs frequently in dialogue and informal conversational
settings, but despite its evident impact on event coreference resolution and
extraction, there has been relatively little work on computational methods for
identifying and resolving VPE. Here, we present a novel approach to detecting
and resolving VPE by using supervised discriminative machine learning
techniques trained on features extracted from an automatically parsed, publicly
available dataset. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results for VPE
detection by improving F1 score by over 11\%; additionally, we explore an
approach to antecedent identification that uses the
Margin-Infused-Relaxed-Algorithm, which shows promising results.
