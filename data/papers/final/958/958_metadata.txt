Abstract#==#Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering natural-language
questions about images. We introduce the novel problem of determining the
relevance of questions to images in VQA. Current VQA models do not reason about
whether a question is even related to the given image (e.g., What is the
capital of Argentina?) or if it requires information from external resources to
answer correctly. This can break the continuity of a dialogue in human-machine
interaction. Our approaches for determining relevance are composed of two
stages. Given an image and a question, (1) we first determine whether the
question is visual or not, (2) if visual, we determine whether the question is
relevant to the given image or not. Our approaches, based on LSTM-RNNs, VQA
model uncertainty, and caption-question similarity, are able to outperform
strong baselines on both relevance tasks. We also present human studies showing
that VQA models augmented with such question relevance reasoning are perceived
as more intelligent, reasonable, and human-like.
