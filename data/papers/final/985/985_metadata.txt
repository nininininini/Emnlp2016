Abstract#==#Determining whether a major societal event has already happened, is still
on-going, or may occur in the future is crucial for event prediction, timeline
generation, and news summarization. We introduce a new task and a new corpus,
EventStatus, which has 4500 English and Spanish articles about civil unrest
events labeled as PAST, ON-GOING, or FUTURE. We show that the temporal status
of these events is difficult to classify because local tense and aspect cues
are often lacking, time expressions are insufficient, and the linguistic
contexts have rich semantic compositionality. We explore two approaches for
event status classification: (1) a feature-based SVM classifier augmented with
a novel induced lexicon of future-oriented verbs, such as “threatened” and
“planned”, and (2) a convolutional neural net. Both types of classifiers
improve event status recognition over a state-of-the-art TempEval model, and
our analysis offers linguistic insights into the semantic compositionality
challenges for this new task.
