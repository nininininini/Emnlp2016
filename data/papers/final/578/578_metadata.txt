Abstract#==#Users prefer natural language software requirements because of their usability
and accessibility. When they describe their wishes for software development,
they often provide off-topic information. We therefore present REaCT, an
automated approach for identifying and semantically annotating the on-topic
parts of requirement descriptions. It is designed to support requirement
engineers in the elicitation process on detecting and analyzing requirements in
user-generated content. Since no lexical resources with domain-specific
information about requirements are available, we created a corpus of
requirements written in controlled language by instructed users and
uncontrolled language by uninstructed users. We annotated these requirements
regarding predicate-argument structures, conditions, priorities, motivations
and semantic roles and used this information to train classifiers for
information extraction purposes. REaCT achieves an accuracy of 92% for the on-
and off-topic classification task and an F1-measure of 72% for the semantic
annotation.
