Abstract#==#We present a shift-reduce CCG semantic parser. Our parser uses a neural network
architecture that balances model capacity and computational cost. We train by
transferring a model from a computationally expensive log-linear CKY parser.
Our learner addresses two challenges: selecting the best parse for learning
when the CKY parser generates multiple correct trees, and learning from partial
derivations when the CKY parser fails to parse. We evaluate on AMR parsing. Our
parser performs comparably to the CKY parser, while doing significantly fewer
operations. We also present results for greedy semantic parsing with a
relatively small drop in performance.
