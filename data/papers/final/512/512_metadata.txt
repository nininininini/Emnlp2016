Abstract#==#Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results across many
  language processing tasks, however these methods are highly sensitive to
noise and adversarial attacks.
  We present a regularization based method for limiting network sensitivity to
its
  inputs, inspired by ideas from computer vision, thus learning models
  that are more robust.
  Empirical evaluation over a range of sentiment datasets with a
  convolutional neural network shows that, compared to a baseline
  model and the dropout method, our method achieves superior
  performance over noisy inputs and out-of-domain
  data.
