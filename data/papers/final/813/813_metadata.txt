Abstract#==#Open information extraction (Open IE) was presented as an unrestricted variant
of traditional information extraction. It has been gaining substantial
attention, manifested by a large number of automatic Open IE extractors and
downstream applications.
In spite of this broad attention, the Open IE task definition has been lacking
-- there are no formal guidelines and no large scale gold standard annotation.
Subsequently, the various implementations of Open IE resorted to small scale
post-hoc evaluations, inhibiting an objective and reproducible cross-system
comparison.
In this work, we develop a methodology that leverages the recent QA-SRL
annotation to create a first independent and large scale Open IE annotation,
and use it to automatically compare the most prominent Open IE systems.
