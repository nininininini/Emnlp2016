Abstract#==#For many low-resource languages, spoken language resources are more likely to
be annotated with translations than with transcriptions. Translated speech data
is potentially valuable for documenting endangered languages or for training
speech translation systems. A first step towards making use of such data would
be to automatically align spoken words with their translations. 
We present a model that combines Dyer et al.'s reparameterization of IBM Model
2 (fast_align) and k-means clustering using Dynamic Time Warping as a distance
metric. The two components are trained jointly using expectation-maximization.
In an extremely low-resource scenario, our model performs significantly better
than both a neural model and a strong baseline.
