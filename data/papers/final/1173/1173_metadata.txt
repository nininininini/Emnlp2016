Abstract#==#Named Entity Recognition is a well established information extraction task with
many state of the art systems existing for a variety of languages. Most systems
rely on language specific resources, large annotated corpora, gazetteers and
feature engineering to perform well monolingually. In this paper, we introduce
an attentional neural model which only uses language universal phonological
character representations with word embeddings to achieve state of the art
performance in a monolingual setting using supervision and which can quickly
adapt to a new language with minimal or no data. We demonstrate that
phonological character representations facilitate cross-lingual transfer,
outperform orthographic representations and incorporating both attention and
phonological features improves statistical efficiency of the model in 0-shot
and low data transfer settings with no task specific feature engineering in the
source or target language.
