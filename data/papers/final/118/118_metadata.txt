Abstract#==#An important aspect of natural language understanding involves recognizing and
categorizing events and the relations among them. However, these tasks are
quite subtle and annotating training data for machine learning based approaches
is an expensive task, resulting in supervised systems that attempt to learn
complex models from small amounts of data, which they over-fit. This paper
addresses this challenge by developing an event detection and co-reference
system with minimal supervision, in the form of a few event examples. We view
these tasks as semantic similarity problems between event mentions or event
mentions and an ontology of types, thus facilitating the use of large amounts
of out of domain text data. Notably, our semantic relatedness function exploits
the structure of the text by making use of a semantic-role-labeling based
representation of an event. 

We show that our approach to event detection is competitive with the top
supervised methods. More significantly, we outperform state-of-the-art
supervised methods for event co-reference on benchmark data sets, and support
significantly better transfer across domains.
