Abstract#==#Lexical simplification of scientific terms represents a unique challenge due to
the lack of a standard parallel corpora and fast rate at which vocabulary shift
along with research. We introduce SimpleScience, a lexical simplification
approach for scientific terminology. We use word embeddings to extract
simplification rules from a parallel corpora containing scientific publications
and Wikipedia. To evaluate our system we construct SimpleSciGold, a novel gold
standard set for science-related simplifications. We find that our approach
outperforms prior context-aware approaches at generating simplifications for
scientific terms.
