Abstract#==#Taxonomic relation identification aims to recognize the 'is-a' relation between
two terms. Previous works on identifying taxonomic relations are mostly based
on statistical and linguistic approaches, but the accuracy of these approaches
is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised learning
approach for identifying taxonomic relations  using term embeddings. For this
purpose, we first design a dynamic weighting neural network to learn term
embeddings based on not only the hypernym and hyponym terms, but also the
contextual information between them. We then apply such embeddings as features
to identify taxonomic relations using a supervised method. The experimental
results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by 9% to 13% in terms of accuracy for both general and
specific domain datasets.
