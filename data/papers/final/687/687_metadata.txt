Abstract#==#Dependency tree-to-tree translation models are powerful because they
 can naturally handle long range reorderings which is important for
 distant language pairs. The translation process is easy if it can be
 accomplished only by replacing non-terminals in translation rules with
 other rules. However it is sometimes necessary to adjoin translation
 rules. Flexible non-terminals have been proposed as a promising
 solution for this problem. A flexible non-terminal provides several
 insertion position candidates for the rules to be adjoined, but it
 increases the computational cost of decoding. In this paper we propose
 a neural network based insertion position selection model to reduce the
 computational cost by selecting the appropriate insertion
 positions. The experimental results show the proposed model can select
 the appropriate insertion position with a high accuracy. It reduces the
 decoding time and improves the translation quality owing to reduced
 search space.
