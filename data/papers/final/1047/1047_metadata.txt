Abstract#==#We present EpiReader, a novel model for machine comprehension of text. Machine
comprehension of unstructured, real-world text is a major research goal for
natural language processing. Current tests of machine comprehension pose
questions whose answers can be inferred from some supporting text, and evaluate
a model's response to the questions. EpiReader is an end-to-end neural model
comprising two components: the first component proposes a small set of
candidate answers after comparing a question to its supporting text, and the
second component formulates hypotheses using the proposed candidates and the
question, then reranks the hypotheses based on their estimated concordance with
the supporting text. We present experiments demonstrating that EpiReader sets a
new state-of-the-art on the CNN and Children's Book Test benchmarks,
outperforming previous neural models by a significant margin.
