Abstract#==#While much computational work on fiction has focused on works in the literary
canon, user-created fanfiction presents a unique opportunity to study an
ecosystem of literary production and consumption, embodying qualities both of
large-scale literary data (55 billion tokens) and also a social network (with
over 2 million users).                    We present several empirical analyses of
this
data in
order to illustrate the range of affordances it presents to research in NLP,
computational social science and the digital humanities.  We find that
fanfiction deprioritizes main protagonists in comparison to canonical texts,
has a statistically significant difference in attention allocated to female
characters, and offers promise for predicting reader reactions to stories.
