Abstract#==#We present a semi-automated framework for constructing factoid question
answering (QA) datasets, where an array of question characteristics are
formalized, including structure complexity, function, commonness, answer
cardinality, and paraphrasing. Instead of collecting questions and manually
characterizing them, we employ a reverse procedure, first generating a kind of
graph-structured logical forms from a knowledge base, and then converting them
into questions. Our work is the first to generate questions with explicitly
specified characteristics for QA evaluation. We construct a new QA dataset with
over 5,000 logical form-question pairs, associated with answers from the
knowledge base, and show that datasets constructed in this way enable
fine-grained analyses of QA systems. The dataset can be found in
