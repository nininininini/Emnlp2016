Abstract#==#Parsing accuracy using extremely efficient greedy transition-based parsers has
improved dramatically in recent years thanks to neural-network learning models.
Despite striking results in dependency parsing, however, neural models have not
surpassed state-of-the-art approaches in constituency parsing. To remedy this,
we introduce a new parsing system which uses a stack of sentence spans,
represented by a bare minimum of LSTM features. We also describe a dynamic
oracle for this constituency parsing system.  Training with this oracle, we
achieve the best performance on Penn Treebank of any parser that does not use
reranking or any external data.
