Abstract#==#To create conversational systems working in actual situations, it is crucial to
assume that they interact with multiple agents.
In this work, we tackle addressee and response selection for multi-party
conversation, in which systems are expected to select whom they address as well
as what they say.
The key challenge of this task is to jointly model who is talking about what in
a previous context.
For the joint modeling, we propose two modeling frameworks: 1) static modeling
and 2) dynamic modeling.
To show benchmark results of our frameworks, we created a multi-party
conversation corpus.
Our experiments on the dataset show that the recurrent neural network based
models of our frameworks robustly predict addressees and responses in
conversations with a large number of agents.
