Abstract#==#Sequences found at the beginning of TV shows help the audience absorb the
essence of previous episodes, and grab their attention with upcoming plots. In
this paper, we propose a novel task, text recap extraction. Compared with
conventional summarization, text recap extraction captures the duality of
summarization and plot contingency between adjacent episodes. We present a new
dataset, TVRecap, for text recap extraction on TV shows. We propose an
unsupervised model that identifies text recaps based on plot descriptions. We
introduce two contingency factors, concept coverage and sparse reconstruction,
that encourage recaps to prompt the upcoming story development. We also propose
a multi-view extension of our model which can incorporate dialogues and
synopses. We conduct extensive experiments on TVRecap, and conclude that our
model outperforms summarization approaches.
