Abstract#==#Review spam detection is a key task in opinion mining. To accomplish this type
of detection, previous work has focused mainly on effectively representing fake
and non-fake reviews with discriminative features, which are discovered or
elaborately designed by experts or developers. This paper proposes a novel
review spam detection method that learns the representation of reviews
automatically instead of heavily relying on experts' knowledge in a data-driven
manner. More specifically, according to 11 relations (generated automatically
from two basic patterns) between reviewers and products, we employ tensor
decomposition to learn the embeddings of the reviewers and products in a vector
space. We collect relations between any two entities (reviewers and products),
which results in much useful and global information. We concatenate the review
text, the embeddings of the reviewer and the reviewed product as the
representation of a review. Based on such representations, the classifier could
identify the opinion spam more precisely. Experimental results on an open Yelp
dataset show that our method could effectively enhance the spam detection
accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
