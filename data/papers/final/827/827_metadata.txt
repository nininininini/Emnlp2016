Abstract#==#We propose a fast and scalable method for semi-supervised learning of sequence
models, based on anchor words and moment matching. Our method can handle hidden
Markov models with feature-based log-linear emissions. Unlike other
semi-supervised methods, no decoding passes are necessary on the unlabeled data
and no graph needs to be constructed---only one pass is necessary to collect
moment statistics. The model parameters are estimated by solving a small
quadratic program for each feature. Experiments on part-of-speech (POS) tagging
for Twitter and for a low resource language (Malagasy) show that our method can
learn from very few annotated sentences.
