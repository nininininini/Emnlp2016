Abstract#==#In timeline extraction the goal is to order all the events in which a target
entity is involved in a timeline. Due to the lack of explicitly annotated data,
previous work is primarily rule-based and uses pre-trained temporal linking
systems. In this work, we propose a distantly supervised approach by
heuristically aligning timelines with documents. The noisy training data
created allows us to learn models that anchor events to temporal expressions
and entities; during testing, the predictions of these models are combined to
produce the timeline. Furthermore, we show how to improve performance using
joint inference. In experiments in the SemEval-2015 TimeLine task we show that
our distantly supervised approach matches the state-of-the-art performance
while joint inference further improves on it by 3.2 F-score points.
