Abstract#==#Tree transducers that model expressive linguistic phenomena often require
word-alignments and a heuristic rule extractor to induce their grammars. 
However, when the corpus of tree/string pairs is small compared to the size of
the vocabulary or the complexity of the grammar, word-alignments are
unreliable.  We propose a general rule extraction algorithm that uses cost
functions over tree fragments, and formulate the extraction as a cost
minimization problem.  As a by-product, we are able to introduce back-off
states at which some cost functions generate right-hand-sides of previously
unseen left-hand-sides, thus creating transducer rules ``on-the-fly''.               
     

We test
the generalization power of our induced tree transducers on a QA task over a
large Knowledge Base, obtaining a reasonable syntactic accuracy and effectively
overcoming the typical lack of rule coverage.
