Abstract#==#In this paper, we study cross-domain sentiment classification with neural
network architectures. We borrow the idea from Structural Correspondence
Learning and use two auxiliary tasks to help induce a sentence embedding that
supposedly works well across domains for sentiment classification. We also
propose to jointly learn this sentence embedding together with the sentiment
classifier itself. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed joint model
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.
