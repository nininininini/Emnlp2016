Abstract#==#We investigate whether psychological well-being translates across English and
Spanish Twitter, by building and comparing source language and automatically
translated weighted lexica in English and Spanish. We find that the source
language models perform substantially better than the machine translated
versions. Moreover, manually correcting translation errors does not improve
model performance, suggesting that meaningful cultural information is being
lost in translation. Further work is needed to clarify when automatic
translation of well-being lexica is effective and how it can be improved for
cross-cultural analysis.
