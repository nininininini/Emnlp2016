Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a study on personalized emphasis framing which can be
used to tailor the content of a message to enhance its appeal to different
individuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions
based on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits
including personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness)  and basic
human values (e.g.,  self-transcendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate how
the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection
for persuasive message generation.
