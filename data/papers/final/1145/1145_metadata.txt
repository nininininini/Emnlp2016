Abstract#==#We propose a text-based recommendation engine that utilizes recurrent neural
networks to flexibly map textual input into continuous vector representations
tailored to the recommendation task. Here, the text objects are documents such
as Wikipedia articles or question and answer pairs. As neural models require
substantial training time, we introduce a sequential component so as to quickly
adjust the learned metric over objects as additional evidence accrues. We
evaluate the approach on recommending Wikipedia descriptions of ingredients to
their associated product categories. We also exemplify the sequential metric
adjustment on retrieving similar Stack Exchange AskUbuntu questions.
