Abstract#==#To alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we propose to use
bilingually-constrained synthetic
implicit data for implicit discourse relation recognition. These data are
extracted from a bilingual sentence-aligned corpus according to the
implicit/explicit mismatch between different languages. Incorporating these
data via a multi-task neural network model achieves significant improvements
over baselines, on both the English PDTB and Chinese CDTB data sets.
