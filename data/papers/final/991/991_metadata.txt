Abstract#==#For AI systems to reason about real world situations, they need to recognize
which processes are at play and which entities play key roles in them. Our goal
is to extract this kind of role-based knowledge about processes, from multiple
sentence-level descriptions. This knowledge is hard to acquire; while semantic
role labeling (SRL) systems can extract sentence level role information about
individual mentions of a process, their results are often noisy and they do not
attempt create a globally consistent characterization of a process. 

To overcome this, we extend standard within sentence joint inference to
inference across multiple sentences. This cross sentence inference promotes
role assignments that are compatible across different descriptions of the same
process. When formulated as an Integer Linear Program, this leads to
improvements over within-sentence inference by nearly 3 % in F1. The resulting
role-based knowledge is of high quality (with a F1 of nearly 82).
