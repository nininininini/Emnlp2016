Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our approach of enabling an interactive dialogue
system to recognize user emotion and sentiment in realtime. These modules allow
otherwise conventional dialogue systems to have “empathy” and answer to the
user while being aware of their emotion and intent. Emotion recognition from
speech previously consists of feature engineering and machine learning where
the first stage causes delay in decoding time. We describe a CNN model to
extract emotion from raw speech input without feature engineering. This
approach even achieves an impressive average of 65.7% accuracy on six emotion
categories, a 4.5% improvement when compared to the conventional feature based
SVM classification. A separate, CNN-based sentiment analysis module recognizes
sentiments from speech recognition results, with 74.8 F-measure on
human-machine dialogues when trained with out-of-domain data.
