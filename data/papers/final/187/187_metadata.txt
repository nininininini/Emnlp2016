Abstract#==#Recent work on machine translation has used crowdsourcing to reduce costs of
manual evaluations. However, crowdsourced judgments are often biased and
inaccurate. In this paper, we present a statistical model that aggregates many
manual pairwise comparisons to robustly measure a machine translation system's
performance. Our method applies graded response model from item response theory
(IRT), which was originally developed for academic tests. We conducted
experiments on a public dataset from the Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation 2013, and found that our approach resulted in highly interpretable
estimates and was less affected by noisy judges than previously proposed
methods.
