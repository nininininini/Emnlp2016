Abstract#==#Lexical taxonomies are graph-like hierarchical structures that provide a formal
representation of knowledge. Most knowledge graphs to date rely on is-a
(hypernymic) relations as the backbone of their semantic structure. In this
paper, we propose a supervised distributional framework for hypernym discovery
which operates at the sense level, enabling large-scale automatic acquisition
of disambiguated taxonomies. By exploiting semantic regularities between
hyponyms and hypernyms in embeddings spaces, and integrating a domain
clustering algorithm, our model becomes sensitive to the target data. We
evaluate several configurations of our approach, training with information
derived from a manually created knowledge base, along with hypernymic relations
obtained from Open Information Extraction systems. The integration of both
sources of knowledge yields the best overall results according to both
automatic and manual evaluation on ten different domains.
