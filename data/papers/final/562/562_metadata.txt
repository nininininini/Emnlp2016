Abstract#==#Mapping word embeddings of different languages into a single space has multiple
applications. In order to map from a source space into a target space, a common
approach is to learn a linear mapping that minimizes the distances between
equivalences listed in a bilingual dictionary. In this paper, we propose a
framework that generalizes previous work, provides an efficient exact method to
learn the optimal linear transformation and yields the best bilingual results
in translation induction while preserving monolingual performance in an analogy
task.
