Abstract#==#Search personalization that considers the social dimension of the web has
attracted a significant volume of research in recent years. A user profile is
usually needed to represent a user’s interests in order to tailor future
searches. Previous research has typically constructed a profile solely from a
user’s usage information. When the user has only limited activities in the
system, the effect of the user profile on search is also constrained. This
research addresses the setting where a user has only a limited amount of usage
information. We build enhanced user profiles from a set of annotations and
resources that users have marked, together with an external knowledge base
constructed according to usage histories. We present two probabilistic latent
topic models to simultaneously incorporate social annotations, documents and
the external knowledge base. Our web search strategy is achieved using
personalized social query expansion. We introduce a topical query expansion
model to enhance the search by utilizing individual user profiles. The proposed
approaches have been intensively evaluated on a large pub-lic social annotation
dataset. Results show that our models significantly outperformed existing
personalized query expansion methods which use user profiles solely built from
past usage in-formation in personalized search.
