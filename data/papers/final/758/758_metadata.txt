Abstract#==#We address the problem of answering new questions in community forums, by
selecting suitable answers to already asked questions. We approach the task as
an answer ranking problem, adopting a pairwise neural network architecture that
selects which of two competing answers is better. We focus on the utility of
the three types of similarities occurring in the triangle formed by the
original question, the related question, and an answer to the related comment,
which we call relevance, relatedness, and appropriateness. Our proposed neural
network models the interactions among all input components using syntactic and
semantic embeddings, lexical matching, and domain-specific features. It
achieves state-of-the-art results, showing that the three similarities are
important and need to be modeled together. Our experiments demonstrate that all
feature types are relevant, but the most important ones are the lexical
similarity features, the domain-specific features, and the syntactic and
semantic embeddings.
