Abstract#==#The brain is the locus of our language ability, and so brain images can be used
to ground linguistic theories. Here we introduce BrainBench, a lightweight
system for testing distributional models of word semantics. We compare the
performance of several models, and show that the performance on brain-image
tasks differs from the performance on behavioral tasks. We release our
benchmark test as part of a web service.
