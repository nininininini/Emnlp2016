Abstract#==#We present the Structured Weighted Violations
Perceptron (SWVP) algorithm, a new structured
prediction algorithm that generalizes the
Collins Structured Perceptron (CSP, (Collins,
2002)). Unlike CSP, the update rule of SWVP
explicitly exploits the internal structure of the
predicted labels. We prove the convergence
of SWVP for linearly separable training sets,
provide mistake and generalization bounds,
and show that in the general case these bounds
are tighter than those of the CSP special case.
In synthetic data experiments with data drawn
from an HMM, various variants of SWVP
substantially outperform its CSP special case.
SWVP also provides encouraging initial dependency
parsing results.
