Abstract#==#In this work, we show the possibility of inferring the answer type before
solving a factoid question and leveraging the type information to improve
semantic parsing.  By replacing the topic entity in a question with its type,
we are able to generate an abstract form of the question, whose answer
corresponds to the answer type of the original question. A bidirectional LSTM
model is built to train over the abstract form of questions and infer their
answer types.  It is also observed that if we convert a question into a
statement form, our LSTM model achieves better accuracy.  Using the predicted
type information to rerank the logical forms returned by AgendaIL, one of the
leading semantic parsers, we are able to improve the F1-score from 49.7 to 52.6
on the WEBQUESTIONS data.
