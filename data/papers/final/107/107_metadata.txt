Abstract#==#Recently a variety of LSTM-based conditional language models (LM) have been
applied across a range of language generation tasks.
In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to
represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue
system framework.
A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from
supervised sequential signals by applying a {\it companion} cross-entropy
objective function to the conditioning vector.
The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition
occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing
architectures provide different trade-offs between the two.
Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector
is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. 
Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements
independent of which architecture is used.
