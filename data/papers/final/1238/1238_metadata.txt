Abstract#==#Automatic satire detection is a subtle text classification task, for machines
and at times, even for humans. In this paper we argue that satire detection
should be approached using common-sense inferences, rather than traditional
text classification methods. We present a highly structured latent variable
model capturing the required inferences. The model abstracts over the specific
entities appearing in the articles, grouping them into generalized categories,
thus allowing the model to adapt to previously unseen situations.
