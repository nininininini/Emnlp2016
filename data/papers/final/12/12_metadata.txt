Abstract#==#Temporal common sense has applications in AI tasks such as QA, multi-document
summarization, and human-AI communication. We propose the task of sequencing --
given a jumbled set of aligned image-caption pairs that belong to a story, the
task is to sort them such that the output sequence forms a coherent story. We
present multiple approaches, via unary (position) and pairwise (order)
predictions, and their ensemble-based combinations, achieving strong results on
this task. We use both text-based and image-based features, which depict
complementary improvements. Using qualitative examples, we demonstrate that our
models have learnt interesting aspects of temporal common sense.
