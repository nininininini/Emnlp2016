Abstract#==#We operate a change of paradigm and hypothesize that keywords are more likely
to be found among influential nodes of a graph-of-words rather than among its
nodes high on eigenvector-related centrality measures. To test this hypothesis,
we introduce unsupervised techniques that capitalize on graph degeneracy. Our
methods strongly and significantly outperform all baselines on two datasets
(short and medium size documents), and reach best performance on the third one
(long documents).
