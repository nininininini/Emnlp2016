Abstract#==#We investigate evaluation metrics for dialogue response generation systems
where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. Recent
works in response generation have adopted metrics from machine translation to
compare a model's generated response to a single target response. We show that
these metrics correlate very weakly with human judgements in the non-technical
Twitter domain, and not at all in the technical Ubuntu domain. We provide
quantitative and qualitative results highlighting specific weaknesses in
existing metrics, and provide recommendations for future development of better
automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems.
