Abstract#==#We present a model for contrastively describing scenes, in which contrastive
behavior results from a combination of inference-driven pragmatics and learned
semantics.  Like previous learned approaches to language generation, our model
uses a simple feature-driven architecture (here a pair of neural ``listener''
and ``speaker'' models) to ground language in the world. Like inference-driven
approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior
when selecting utterances. For training, our approach requires only ordinary
captions, annotated without demonstration of the pragmatic behavior the
model ultimately exhibits. In human evaluations on a referring expression
game, our approach succeeds 81% of the time, compared to 69% using existing 
techniques.
