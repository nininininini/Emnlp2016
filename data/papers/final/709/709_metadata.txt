Abstract#==#We describe Hafez, a program that generates any number of distinct poems on a
user-supplied topic.  Poems obey rhythmic and rhyme constraints.  We describe
the poetry-generation algorithm, give experimental data concerning its
parameters, and show its generality with respect to language and poetic form.
