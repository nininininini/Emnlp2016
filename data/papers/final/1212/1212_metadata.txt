Abstract#==#Center-embedding is difficult to process and is known as a rare syntactic
construction across languages. In this paper we describe a method to
incorporate this assumption into the grammar induction tasks by restricting the
search space of a model to trees with limited center-embedding. The key idea is
the tabulation of {\it left-corner} parsing, which captures the degree of
center-embedding of a parse via its stack depth. We apply the technique to
learning of famous generative model, the dependency model with valence (Klein
and Manning, 2004). Cross-linguistic experiments on Universal Dependencies show
that often our method boosts the performance from the baseline, and competes
with the current state-of-the-art model in a number of languages.
