Abstract#==#This study measures the effects of Federal Open Market Committee text content
on 
the direction of short- and medium-term interest rate movements. Because the 
words relevant to short- and medium-term interest rates differ, we apply a 
supervised approach to learn distinct sets of topics for each dependent
variable 
being examined. We generate predictions with and without controlling for
factors 
relevant to interest rate movements, and our prediction results average across 
multiple training-test splits. Using data from 1999-2016, we achieve 93\% and
64\% 
accuracy in predicting Target and Effective Federal Funds Rate movements and
38\%-40\% 
accuracy in predicting longer term Treasury Rate movements. We obtain lower but

comparable accuracies after controlling for other macroeconomic and market
factors.
