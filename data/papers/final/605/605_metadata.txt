Abstract#==#Implicit discourse relation recognition is a
crucial component for automatic discourselevel
analysis and nature language understanding.
Previous studies exploit discriminative
models that are built on either powerful manual
features or deep discourse representations.
In this paper, instead, we explore generative
models and propose a variational neural discourse
relation recognizer. We refer to this
model as VarNDRR. VarNDRR establishes a
directed probabilistic model with a latent continuous
variable that generates both a discourse
and the relation between the two arguments
of the discourse. In order to perform
efficient inference and learning, we introduce
neural discourse relation models to
approximate the prior and posterior distributions
of the latent variable, and employ these
approximated distributions to optimize a reparameterized
variational lower bound. This allows
VarNDRR to be trained with standard
stochastic gradient methods. Experiments on
the benchmark data set show that VarNDRR
can achieve comparable results against stateof-
the-art baselines without using any manual
features.
