Abstract#==#Chinese character riddle is a riddle game in which the riddle solution is a
single Chinese character. It is closely connected with the shape, pronunciation
or meaning of Chinese characters. The riddle description (sentence) is usually
composed of phrases with rich linguistic phenomena (such as pun, simile, and
metaphor), which are associated to different parts (namely radicals) of the
solution character. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework to solve
and generate Chinese character riddles. Specifically, we learn the alignments
and rules to identify the metaphors between phrases in riddles and radicals in
characters. Then, in the solving phase, we utilize a dynamic programming method
to combine the identified metaphors to obtain candidate solutions. In the
riddle generation phase, we use a template-based method and a replacement-based
method to obtain candidate riddle descriptions. We then use Ranking SVM to
rerank the candidates both in the solving and generation process. Experimental
results in the solving task show that the proposed method outperform baseline
methods. We also get very promising results in the generation task according to
human judges.
