Abstract#==#A common problem in cognitive modelling is lack of access to accurate
broad-coverage models of event-level surprisal. As shown in, e.g., Bicknell et
al. (2010), event-level knowledge does affect human expectations for verbal
arguments. For example, the model should be able to predict that "mechanics"
are likely to check "tires", while "journalists" are more likely to check
"typos". Similarly, we would like to predict what locations are likely for
"playing football" or "playing flute" in order to estimate the surprisal of
actually-encountered locations. Furthermore, such a model can be used to
provide a probability distribution over fillers for a thematic role which is
not mentioned in the text at all.

To this end, we train two neural network models (an incremental one and a
non-incremental one) on large amounts of automatically role-labelled text. Our
models are probabilistic and can handle several roles at once, which also
enables them to learn interactions between different role fillers. Evaluation
shows a drastic improvement over current state-of-the-art systems on modelling
human thematic fit judgements, and we demonstrate via a sentence similarity
task that the system learns highly useful embeddings.
