Abstract#==#Most existing knowledge base (KB) embedding methods solely learn from
time-unknown fact triples but neglect the temporal information in the knowledge
base. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware KB embedding approach taking
advantage of the happening time of facts. Specifically, we use temporal order
constraints to model transformation between time-sensitive relations and
enforce the embeddings to be temporally consistent and more accurate.
We empirically evaluate our approach in two tasks of link prediction and triple
classification. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other
baselines on the two tasks consistently.
