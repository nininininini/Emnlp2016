Abstract#==#When considering a social media corpus, we often have access to structural
information about how messages are flowing between people or organizations. 
This information is particularly useful when the linguistic evidence is sparse,
incomplete, or of dubious quality.  In this paper we construct a simple model
to leverage the structure of Twitter data to help determine the set of
languages each user is fluent in.  Our results demonstrate that imposing
several intuitive constraints leads to improvements in performance and
stability.  We release the first annotated data set for exploring this task,
and discuss how our approach may be extended to other applications.
