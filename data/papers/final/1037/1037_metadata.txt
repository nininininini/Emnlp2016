Abstract#==#Automatically solving algebra word problems has raised considerable interest
recently. Existing state-of-the-art approaches mainly rely on learning from
human annotated equations. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to
efficiently mine algebra problems and their numerical solutions with little to
no manual effort. To leverage the mined dataset, we propose a novel
structured-output learning algorithm that aims to learn from both explicit
(e.g., equations) and implicit (e.g., solutions) supervision signals jointly.
Enabled by this new algorithm, our model gains 4.6% absolute improvement in
accuracy on the ALG-514 benchmark compared to the one without using implicit
supervision. The final model also outperforms the current state-of-the-art
approach by 3%.
