Abstract#==#Linguistic research on multilingual societies has indicated that there is
usually a preferred language for expression of emotion and sentiment. Paucity
of data has limited such studies to participant interviews and speech
transcriptions from small groups of speakers. In this paper, we report a study
on 430,000 unique tweets from Indian users, specifically Hindi-English
bilinguals, to understand the language of preference, if any, for expressing
opinion and sentiment. To this end, we develop classifiers for opinion
detection in these languages, and further classifying opinionated tweets into
positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Our study indicates that Hindi
(i.e., the native language) is preferred over English for expression of
negative opinion and swearing. As an aside, we explore some common pragmatic
functions of code-switching through sentiment detection.
