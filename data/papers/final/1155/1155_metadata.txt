Abstract#==#In this paper we discuss a process for quantifying the behavioral impact of a
domain-customized machine translation system deployed on a large-scale
e-commerce platform. We discuss several machine translation systems that we
trained using aligned text from product listing descriptions written in
multiple languages. We document the quality improvements of these systems as
measured through automated quality measures and crowdsourced human quality
assessments. We then measure the effect of these quality improvements on user
behavior using an automated A/B testing framework. Through testing we observed
an increase in key e-commerce metrics, including a significant increase in
purchases.
