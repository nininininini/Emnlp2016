Abstract#==#Significant events are characterized by interactions between entities
(such as countries, organizations, or individuals) that deviate from
typical interaction patterns. Analysts, including historians,
political scientists, and journalists, commonly read large quantities
of text to construct an accurate picture of when and where an event
happened, who was involved, and in what ways. In this paper, we
present the Capsule model for analyzing documents to detect
and characterize events of potential significance. Specifically, we
develop a model based on topic modeling that distinguishes between
topics that describe "business as usual" and topics that deviate
from these patterns. To demonstrate this model, we analyze a corpus of
over two million U.S. State Department cables from the 1970s. We
provide an open-source implementation of an inference algorithm for
the model and a pipeline for exploring its results.
