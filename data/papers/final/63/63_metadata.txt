Abstract#==#We argue that NLP researchers are especially well-positioned to contribute to
the national discussion about gun violence. Reasoning about the causes and
outcomes of gun violence is typically dominated by politics and emotion, and
data-driven research on the topic is stymied by a shortage of data and a lack
of federal funding. However, data abounds in the  form of unstructured text
from news articles across the country. This is an ideal application of NLP
technologies, such as relation extraction, coreference resolution, and event
detection. We introduce a new and growing dataset, the Gun Violence Database,
in order to facilitate the adaptation of current NLP technologies to the domain
of gun violence, thus enabling better social science research on this important
and under-resourced problem.
