Abstract#==#Chinese named entities occur frequently in formal and informal environments.
Various approaches have been formalized the problem as a sequence labelling
task and utilize a character-based methodology, in which character is treated
as the basic classification unit. One of the main drawbacks of these methods is
that some of the generated abbreviations may not follow the conventional wisdom
of Chinese. To address this problem, we propose a novel neural network
architecture to perform task. It combines recurrent neural network (RNN) with
an architecture determining whether a given sequence of characters can be a
word or not. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
evaluate it on Chinese named entity generation and opinion target extraction
tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better
performance than state-of-the-art methods.
