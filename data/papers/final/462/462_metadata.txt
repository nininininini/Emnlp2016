Abstract#==#Discourse parsing is considered as one of the most challenging natural language
processing (NLP) tasks. Implicit discourse relation classification is the
bottleneck for discourse parsing. Without the guide of explicit discourse
connectives, the relation of sentence pairs are very hard to be inferred.  This
paper proposes a stacking neural network model to solve the classification
problem in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized for sentence
modeling and a collaborative gated neural network (CGNN) is proposed for
feature transformation. 
Our evaluation and comparisons show that the proposed model outperforms
previous state-of-the-art systems.
