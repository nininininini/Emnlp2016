Abstract#==#The production of color language is essential for grounded language generation.
Color descriptions have many challenging properties: they can be vague,
compositionally complex, and denotationally rich. We present an effective
approach to generating color descriptions using recurrent neural networks and a
Fourier-transformed color representation. Our model outperforms previous work
on a conditional language modeling task over a large corpus of naturalistic
color descriptions. In addition, probing the model's output reveals that it can
accurately produce not only basic color terms but also descriptors with
non-convex denotations ("greenish"), bare modifiers ("bright", "dull"), and
compositional phrases ("faded teal") not seen in training.
