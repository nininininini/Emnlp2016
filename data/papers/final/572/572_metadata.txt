Abstract#==#Verbs play a critical role in the meaning of sentences, but these ubiquitous
words have received little attention in recent distributional semantics
research. 
We introduce SimVerb-3500, an evaluation resource that provides human ratings
for the similarity of 3,500 verb pairs.  SimVerb-3500 covers all normed verb
types from the USF free-association database, providing at least three examples
for every VerbNet class. This broad coverage facilitates detailed analyses of
how syntactic and semantic phenomena together influence human understanding of
verb meaning. Further, with significantly larger development and test sets than
existing benchmarks, SimVerb-3500 enables more robust evaluation of
representation learning architectures and promotes the development of methods
tailored to verbs. We hope that SimVerb-3500 will enable a richer understanding
of the diversity and complexity of verb semantics and guide the development of
systems that can effectively represent and interpret this meaning.
