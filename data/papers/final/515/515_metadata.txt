Abstract#==#Stance detection is the task of classifying the attitude  expressed in a text
towards a target such as Hillary Clinton to be ''positive'', ''negative'' or
''neutral''.
Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned in the text or
that training data for every target is given. This paper considers the more
challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned and no
training data is available for the test targets.
We experiment with conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of
the tweet that is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms
encoding the tweet and the target independently. Performance is improved
further when the conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We
evaluate our approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection
corpus achieving performance second best only to a system trained on
semi-automatically labelled tweets for the test target. When such weak
supervision is added, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.
