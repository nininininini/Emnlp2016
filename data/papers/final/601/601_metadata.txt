Abstract#==#Essay scoring is a complicated 
processing requiring analyzing, summarizing and judging expertise. 
Traditional work on essay scoring focused on automatic handcrafted
features, which are expensive yet sparse. Neural models offer a way to learn
syntactic and semantic
features automatically, which can potentially improve upon discrete features.
In this paper, we employ  
convolutional neural network (CNN) for the effect
of automatically learning features, and compare the result with the
state-of-art discrete baselines.
For in-domain and domain-adaptation essay scoring tasks, our neural model 
empirically outperforms discrete models.
