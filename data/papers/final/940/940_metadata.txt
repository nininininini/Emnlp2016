Abstract#==#We study the problem of jointly aligning sentence constituents and predicting
their similarities. While extensive sentence similarity data exists, manually
generating reference alignments and labeling the similarities of the aligned
chunks is comparatively onerous. This prompts the natural question of whether
we can exploit easy-to-create sentence level data to train better aligners. In
this paper, we present a model that learns to jointly align constituents of two
sentences and also predict their similarities. By taking advantage of both
sentence and constituent level data, we show that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance at predicting alignments and constituent
similarities.
