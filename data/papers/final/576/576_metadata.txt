Abstract#==#This paper proposes a method for intra-sentential subject zero anaphora
resolution in Japanese. Our proposed method utilizes a Multi-column
Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) for predicting zero anaphoric relations.
Motivated by Centering Theory and other previous works, we exploit as clues
both the surface word sequence and the dependency tree of a target sentence in
our MCNN. Even though the F-score of our method was lower than that of the
state-of-the-art method, which achieved relatively high recall and low
precision, our method achieved much higher precision (>0.8) in a wide range of
recall levels. We believe such high precision is crucial
for real-world NLP applications and thus our method is preferable to the
state-of-the-art method.
