Abstract#==#The task of AMR-to-text generation is to gen-
erate grammatical text that sustains the seman-
tic meaning for a given AMR graph. We at-
tack the task by first partitioning the AMR
graph into smaller fragments, and then gener-
ating the translation for each fragment, before
finally deciding the order by solving an asym-
metric generalized traveling salesman prob-
lem (AGTSP). A Maximum Entropy classifier
is trained to estimate the traveling costs, and a
TSP solver is used to find the optimized solu-
tion. The final model reports a BLEU score of
22.44 on the SemEval-2016 Task8 dataset.
