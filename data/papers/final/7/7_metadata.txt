Abstract#==#RST-style document-level discourse parsing remains a difficult task and
efficient deep learning models on this task have rarely been presented. In this
paper, we propose an attention-based hierarchical  neural network model for
discourse parsing. We also incorporate tensor-based transformation function to
model complicated feature interactions. Experimental results show that our
approach obtains comparable performance to the contemporary state-of-the-art
systems with little manual feature engineering.
