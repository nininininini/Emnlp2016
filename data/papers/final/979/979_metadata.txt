Abstract#==#We develop a novel embedding-based model for predicting legislative
  roll-call votes from bill text. The model introduces
  multidimensional \textit{ideal vectors} for legislators as an
  alternative to single dimensional ideal point models for
  quantitatively analyzing roll-call data. These vectors are learned
  to correspond with pre-trained word embeddings which allows us to
  analyze which features in a bill text are most predictive of political
  support. Our model is quite simple, while at the same time allowing
  us to successfully predict legislator votes on specific bills with
  higher accuracy than past methods.
