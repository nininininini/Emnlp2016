Abstract#==#This paper presents a system that compositionally maps outputs of a
wide-coverage Japanese CCG parser onto semantic representations and performs
automated inference in higher-order logic. The system is evaluated on a textual
entailment dataset. It is shown that the system solves inference problems that
focus on a variety of complex linguistic phenomena, including those that are
difficult to represent in the standard first-order logic.
