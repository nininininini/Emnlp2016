Abstract#==#Document-level sentiment classification aims to predict user's overall
sentiment in a document about a product. However, most of existing methods only
focus on local text information and ignore the global user preference and
product characteristics. Even though some works take such information into
account, they usually suffer from high model complexity and only consider
word-level preference rather than semantic levels. To address this issue, we
propose a hierarchical neural network  to incorporate global user and product
information into sentiment classification. Our model first builds a
hierarchical LSTM model to generate sentence and document representations.
Afterwards, user and product information is considered via attentions over
different semantic levels due to its ability of capturing crucial semantic
components. The experimental results show that our model achieves significant
and consistent improvements compared to all state-of-the-art methods. The
