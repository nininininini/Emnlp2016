Abstract#==#This paper makes a simple increment to the state-of-
the-art in sarcasm detection research. Existing ap-
proaches are unable to capture subtle forms of con-
text incongruity which lies at the heart of sarcasm.
We explore if prior work can be enhanced using se-
mantic similarity/discordance between word embed-
dings. We augment word embedding-based features
to four feature sets reported in the past. We ex-
periment with four types of word embeddings, and
observe an improvement in sarcasm detection, irre-
spective of the word embedding used or the original
feature set to which our features are augmented. For
example, this augmentation results in an improve-
ment in F-score of around 4% for three out of these
four feature sets, and a minor degradation in case of
the fourth, when word2vec embeddings are used. Fi-
nally, a comparison of the four embeddings shows
that word2vec and dependency weight-based fea-
tures outperform LSA and GloVe, in terms of their
benefit to sarcasm detection.
