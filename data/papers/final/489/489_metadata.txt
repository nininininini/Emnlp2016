Abstract#==#Language documentation begins by gathering speech. Manual or automatic               
     

transcription at the word level is typically not possible because of the       

absence of an orthography or prior lexicon, and though manual phonemic               
     

transcription is possible, it is very slow. On the other hand, translations of 

the minority language into a major language are more easily acquired. We       

propose a method to harness such translations to improve automatic phoneme     

recognition. The method assumes no prior lexicon or translation model, instead 

learning them from phoneme lattices and translations of the speech being       

transcribed. Experiments demonstrate phoneme error rate improvements against   

two baselines and the model's ability to learn useful bilingual lexical        

entries.
