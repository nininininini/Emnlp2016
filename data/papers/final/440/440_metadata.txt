Abstract#==#Identifying mathematical relations expressed in text is essential to
  understanding a broad range of natural language text from election
  reports, to financial news, to sport commentaries to mathematical
  word problems. This paper focuses on identifying and understanding
  mathematical relations described within a single sentence. We
  introduce the problem of Equation Parsing -- given a sentence,
  identify noun phrases which represent variables, and generate the
  mathematical equation expressing the relation described in the
  sentence. We introduce the notion of projective equation parsing and
  provide an efficient algorithm to parse text to projective
  equations. Our system makes use of a high precision lexicon of
  mathematical expressions and a pipeline of structured predictors,
  and generates correct equations in $70\%$ of the cases. In $60\%$ of
  the time, it also identifies the correct noun phrase -->
  variables mapping, significantly outperforming baselines. We also
  release a new annotated dataset for task evaluation.
