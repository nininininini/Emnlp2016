Abstract#==#Distant supervision has been widely used in current systems of fine-grained
entity typing to automatically assign categories (entity types) to entity
mentions. However, the types so obtained from knowledge bases are often
incorrect for the entity mention's local context. This paper proposes a novel
embedding method to separately model "clean" and "noisy" mentions, and
incorporates the given type hierarchy to induce loss functions. We formulate a
joint optimization problem to learn embeddings for mentions and type-paths, and
develop an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method, with an average 15% improvement in accuracy over the next best compared
method.
