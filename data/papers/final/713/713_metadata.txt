Abstract#==#The Xenotext Experiment implants poetry into an extremophile's DNA, and uses
that DNA to generate new poetry in a protein form.  The molecular machinery of
life requires that these two poems encipher each other under a symmetric
substitution cipher. We search for ciphers which permit writing under the
Xenotext constraints, incorporating ideas from cipher-cracking algorithms, and
using n-gram data to assess a cipher's ``writability''. Our algorithm, Beam
Verse, is a beam search which uses new heuristics to navigate the cipher-space.
We find thousands of ciphers which score higher than successful ciphers used to
write Xenotext constrained texts.
