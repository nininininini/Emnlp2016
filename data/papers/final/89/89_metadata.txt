Abstract#==#In this paper, we capture the argument relationships for Chinese semantic role
labeling task, and improve the task's performance with the help  of argument
relationships. We split the  relationship between two candidate arguments into
two categories: (1) Compatible arguments: if one candidate argument belongs to
a given predicate, then the other is more likely to belong to the same
predicate; (2) Incompatible arguments: if one candidate argument belongs to a
given predicate, then the other is less likely to belong to the same predicate.
However, previous works did not explicitly model   argument relationships. We
use a simple maximum entropy classifier to capture the two categories of
argument relationships and test its performance on the Chinese Proposition Bank
(CPB). The experiments show that argument relationships is effective in Chinese
semantic role labeling task.
