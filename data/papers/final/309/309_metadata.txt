Abstract#==#This paper considers the problem of learning Chinese word embeddings. In
contrast to English, a Chinese word is usually composed of characters, and most
of the characters themselves can be further divided into components such as
radicals. While characters and radicals contain rich information and are
capable of indicating semantic meanings of words, they have not been fully
exploited by existing word embedding methods. In this work, we propose
multi-granularity embedding (MGE) for Chinese words. The key idea is to make
full use of such word-character-radical composition, and enrich word embeddings
by further incorporating finer-grained semantics from characters and radicals.
Quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MGE in word similarity
computation and analogical reasoning. Qualitative analysis further shows its
capability to identify finer-grained semantic meanings of words.
