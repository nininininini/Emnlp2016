Abstract#==#Joint dependency parsing with disfluency detection is an important task in
speech language processing. Recent methods show high performance for this task,
although most authors make the unrealistic assumption that input texts are
transcribed by human annotators.
In real-world applications, the input text is typically the output of an
automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, which implies that the text contains
not only disfluency noises but also recognition errors from the ASR system. In
this work, we propose a parsing method that handles both disfluency and ASR
errors using an incremental shift-reduce algorithm with several novel features
suited to ASR output texts. Because the gold dependency information is usually
annotated only on transcribed texts, we also introduce an alignment-based
method for transferring the gold dependency annotation to the ASR output texts
to construct training data for our parser. We conducted an experiment on the
Switchboard corpus and show that our method outperforms conventional methods in
terms of dependency parsing and disfluency detection.
