Abstract#==#We present our pilot research on automatically extracting subevents from a
domain-specific corpus, focusing on the type of subevents that describe
physical actions composing an event. We decompose the challenging problem and
propose a two-phase approach that effectively captures sentential and local
cues that describe subevents. We extracted a rich set of over 600 novel
subevent phrases. Evaluation shows the automatically learned subevents help to
discover 10% additional main events (of which the learned subevents are a part)
and improve event detection performance.
