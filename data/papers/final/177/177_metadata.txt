Abstract#==#Verbal comprehension questions appear very frequently in Intelligence Quotient
(IQ) tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the understanding of
the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and the analogies
among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be solved
automatically by the deep learning technologies for text data. We found that
the task was quite challenging, and simply applying existing technologies like
word embedding could not achieve a good performance, due to the multiple senses
of words and the complex relations among words. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel framework to automatically solve the verbal IQ questions by
leveraging improved word embedding by jointly considering the multi-sense
nature of words and the relational information among words. Experimental
results have shown that the proposed framework can not only outperform existing
methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average
performance of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers involved in the study.
