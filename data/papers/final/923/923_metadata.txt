Abstract#==#Recent work on word ordering has argued that syntactic structure is important,
or even required, for effectively recovering the order of a sentence. We find
that, in fact, an n-gram language model with a simple heuristic gives strong
results on this task. Furthermore, we show that a long short-term memory (LSTM)
language model is even more effective at recovering order, with our basic model
outperforming a state-of-the-art syntactic model by 11.5 BLEU points.
Additional data and larger beams yield further gains, at the expense of
training and search time.
