Abstract#==#Annotation projection based on parallel corpora has shown great promise in
inexpensively creating Proposition Banks for languages for which high-quality
parallel corpora and syntactic parsers are available. In this paper, we conduct
an experimental study where we apply this approach to three languages that lack
such resources: Tamil, Bengali and Malayalam. We find an average quality
difference of 6 to 20 absolute F-measure points vis-a-vis high-resource
languages, which indicates that annotation projection alone is insufficient in
low-resource scenarios. Based on these results, we explore the possibility of
using annotation projection as a starting point for inexpensive data curation
involving both experts and non-experts. We give an outline of what such a
process may look like and present an initial study to discuss its potential and
challenges.
