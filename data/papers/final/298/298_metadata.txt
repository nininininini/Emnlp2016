Abstract#==#In this paper, we improve the attention or alignment accuracy of neural machine
translation by utilizing the alignments of training sentence pairs. We simply
compute the distance between the machine attentions and the “true”
alignments, and minimize this cost in the training procedure. Our experiments
on large-scale Chinese-to-English task show that our model improves both
translation and alignment qualities significantly over the large-vocabulary
neural machine translation system, and even beats a state-of-the-art
traditional syntax-based system.
