Abstract#==#We present a new Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) model for text classification that
jointly exploits labels on documents and their
constituent sentences. Specifically, we consider
scenarios in which annotators explicitly
mark sentences (or snippets) that support
their overall document categorization,
i.e., they provide rationales. Our model exploits
such supervision via a hierarchical approach
in which each document is represented
by a linear combination of the vector representations
of its component sentences. We
propose a sentence-level convolutional model
that estimates the probability that a given sentence
is a rationale, and we then scale the
contribution of each sentence to the aggregate
document representation in proportion to
these estimates. Experiments on five classification datasets that have document
labels and
associated rationales demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms strong baselines.
Moreover, our model naturally provides
explanations for its predictions.
