Abstract#==#To enable language-based communication and collaboration with cognitive robots,
this paper presents an approach where an agent can learn task models jointly
from language instruction and visual demonstration using an And-Or Graph (AoG)
representation. The learned AoG captures a hierarchical task structure where
linguistic labels (for language communication) are grounded to corresponding
state changes from the physical environment (for perception and action). Our
empirical results on a cloth-folding domain have shown that, although state
detection through visual processing is full of uncertainties and error prone,
by a tight integration with language the agent is able to learn an effective
AoG for task representation. The learned AoG can be further applied to infer
and interpret on-going actions from new visual demonstration using linguistic
labels at different levels of granularity.
