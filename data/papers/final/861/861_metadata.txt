Abstract#==#Methods based on representation learning currently hold the state-of-the-art in
many natural language processing and knowledge base inference tasks.
Yet, a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge
into such models.
A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by
propositionalization of first-order logic rules.
However, propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few
entities and rules.
In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating
implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base
construction.
We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and
encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication
rules mined from WordNet.
Surprisingly, we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding
space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a
regularizer that improves generalization.
By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase of 2 percentage
points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline, while
observing a  negligible increase in runtime.
