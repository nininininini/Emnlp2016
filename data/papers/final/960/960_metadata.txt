Abstract#==#In named entity recognition, we often donâ€™t have a large in-domain training
corpus or a knowledge base with adequate coverage to train a model directly. In
this paper, we propose a method where, given training data in a related domain
with similar (but not identical) named entity (NE) types and a small amount of
in-domain training data, we use transfer learning to learn a domain-specific NE
model. That is, the novelty in the task setup is that we assume not just domain
mismatch, but also label mismatch.
