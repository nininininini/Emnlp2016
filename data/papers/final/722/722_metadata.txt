Abstract#==#Situated question answering is the problem of answering questions about an
environment such as an image or diagram. This problem requires jointly
interpreting a question and an environment using background knowledge to select
the correct answer. We present Parsing to Probabilistic Programs (P3), a novel
situated question answering model that can use background knowledge and global
features of the question/environment interpretation while retaining efficient
approximate inference. Our key insight is to treat semantic parses as
probabilistic programs that execute nondeterministically and whose possible
executions represent environmental uncertainty. We evaluate our approach on a
new, publicly-released data set of 5000 science diagram questions,
outperforming several competitive classical and neural baselines.
