Abstract#==#The goal of language modeling techniques is to capture the statistical and
structural properties of natural 
languages from training corpora. This task typically involves the learning of
short range dependencies, 
which generally model the syntactic properties of a language and/or long range
dependencies, which are semantic in nature. 
We propose in this paper a new multi-span architecture, which separately models
the short and long 
context information while it dynamically merges them to perform the language
modeling task. This is 
done through a novel recurrent Long-Short Range Context (LSRC) network, which 
explicitly models the local (short) and global (long) context using two
separate hidden states 
that evolve in time. This new architecture is an adaptation of the Long-Short
Term Memory network 
(LSTM) to take into account the linguistic properties. Extensive experiments
conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) 
and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant
reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art language modeling
techniques.
