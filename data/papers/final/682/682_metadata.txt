Abstract#==#Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture has
recently become a new paradigm. Researchers have proven that the target-side
monolingual data can greatly enhance the decoder model of NMT. However, the
source-side monolingual data is not fully explored although it should be useful
to strengthen the encoder model of NMT, especially when the parallel corpus is
far from sufficient. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make full use
of the source-side monolingual data in NMT. The first approach employs the
self-learning algorithm to generate the synthetic large-scale parallel data for
NMT training. The second approach applies the multi-task learning framework
using two NMTs to predict the translation and the reordered source-side
monolingual sentences simultaneously. The extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed methods obtain significant improvements over the strong
attention-based NMT.
