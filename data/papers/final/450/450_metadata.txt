Abstract#==#This paper introduces STEM and LAMB, 
embeddings trained for stems and lemmata
instead of for surface forms. For
morphologically rich languages, they
perform significantly better than
standard embeddings on word similarity
and polarity evaluations. On a new
WordNet-based evaluation, STEM and LAMB
are up to 50% better than standard
embeddings. We show that both embeddings
have high quality even for small
dimensionality and training corpora.
