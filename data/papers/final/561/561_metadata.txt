Abstract#==#This paper studies summarizing key information from news streams. We propose
simple yet effective models to solve the problem based on a novel and promising
representation of text streams -- Burst Information Networks (BINets). A BINet
can be aware of redundant information, allows global analysis of a text stream,
and can be efficiently built and dynamically updated, which perfectly fits the
demands of text stream summarization. Extensive experiments show that the
BINet-based approaches are not only efficient and can be used in a real-time
online summarization setting, but also can generate high-quality summaries,
outperforming the state-of-the-art approach.
