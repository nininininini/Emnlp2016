Abstract#==#Aspect-level sentiment classification is a fine-grained task in sentiment
analysis. Since it provides more complete and in-depth results, aspect-level
sentiment analysis has received much attention these years. In this paper, we
reveal that the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not only determined by the
content but is also highly related to the concerned aspect. For instance,
“The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.”, for aspect taste, the
polarity is positive while for service, the polarity is negative. Therefore, it
is worthwhile to explore the connection between an aspect and the content of a
sentence. To this end, we propose an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory
Network for aspect-level sentiment classification. The attention mechanism can
concentrate on different parts of a sentence when different aspects are taken
as input. We experiment on the SemEval 2014 dataset and results show that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on aspect-level sentiment
classification.
