Abstract#==#Natural language acquisition relies on appropriate generalization: the ability
to produce novel sentences, while learning to restrict productions to
acceptable forms in the language. Psycholinguists have proposed various
properties that might play a role in guiding appropriate generalizations,
looking at learning of verb alternations as a testbed. Several computational
cognitive models have explored aspects of this phenomenon, but their results
are hard to compare given the high variability in
the linguistic properties represented in their input. In this paper, we
directly compare two recent approaches, a Bayesian model and a connectionist
model, in their ability to replicate human judgments of appropriate
generalizations. We find that the Bayesian model more accurately mimics the
judgments due to its richer learning mechanism that can exploit distributional
properties of the input in a manner consistent with human behaviour.
