Abstract#==#The Dirichlet distribution (Dir) is one of the most widely used prior
distributions in statistical approaches to natural language processing. The
parameters of Dir are required to be positive, which significantly limits its
strength as a sparsity prior. 
In this paper, we propose a simple modification to the Dirichlet distribution
that allows the parameters to be negative. Our modified Dirichlet distribution
(mDir) not only induces much stronger sparsity, but also simultaneously
performs smoothing. mDir is still conjugate to the multinomial distribution,
which simplifies posterior inference. We introduce two simple and efficient
algorithms for finding the mode of mDir. Our experiments on learning Gaussian
mixtures and unsupervised dependency parsing demonstrate the advantage of mDir
over Dir.
