Abstract#==#Morphological segmentation has traditionally been modeled with non-hierarchical
models, which yield flat segmentations as output. In many cases, however,
proper morphological analysis requires hierarchical structure---especially in
the case of derivational morphology. In this work, we introduce a
discriminative joint model of morphological segmentation along with the
orthographic changes that occur during word formation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to approach discriminative segmentation
with a context-free model. Additionally, we release an annotated treebank of
7454 English words with constituency parses, encouraging future research in
this area.
