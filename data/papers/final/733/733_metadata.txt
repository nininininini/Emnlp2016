Abstract#==#We propose a method for learning the structure of variable-order CRFs, a more
flexible variant of higher-order linear-chain CRFs. Variable-order CRFs achieve
faster inference by including features for only some of the tag n-grams.  Our
learning method discovers the useful higher-order features at the same time as
it trains their weights, by maximizing an objective that combines
log-likelihood with a structured-sparsity regularizer.                          An
active-set
outer
loop allows the feature set to grow as far as needed.  On part-of-speech
tagging in 5 randomly chosen languages from the Universal Dependencies dataset,
our method of shrinking the model achieved a 2-6x speedup over a baseline, with
no significant drop in accuracy.
