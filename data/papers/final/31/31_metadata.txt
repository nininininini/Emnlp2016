Abstract#==#We introduce a deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification.
Unlike feature-based SVM and sequential neural models such as LSTM, this
approach explicitly captures the importance of each context word when inferring
the sentiment polarity of an aspect.
Such importance degree and text representation are calculated with multiple
computational layers, each of which is a neural attention model over an
external memory. 
Experiments on laptop and restaurant datasets demonstrate that our approach
performs comparable to state-of-art feature based SVM system,
and substantially better than LSTM and attention-based LSTM architectures.
On both datasets we show that multiple computational layers could improve the
performance.
Moreover, our approach is also fast. The deep memory network with 9 layers is
15 times faster than LSTM with a CPU implementation.
