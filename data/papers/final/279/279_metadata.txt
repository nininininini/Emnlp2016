Abstract#==#To alleviate the error propagation in the traditional pipelined models for
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing, we formulate AMR parsing as a
joint task that performs the two subtasks: concept identification and relation
identification simultaneously. To this end, we first develop a novel
component-wise beam search algorithm for relation identification in an
incremental fashion, and then in-corporate the decoder into a unified
frame-work based on multiple-beam search, which allows for the bi-directional
information flow between the two subtasks in a single incremental model.
Experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our joint model
significantly outperforms the previous pipelined counterparts, and also
achieves better or comparable performance than other approaches to AMR parsing,
without
utilizing external semantic resources.
