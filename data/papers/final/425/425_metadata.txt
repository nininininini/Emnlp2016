Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate case restoration for text without case
information. Previous such work operates at the word level. We propose an
approach using character-level recurrent neural networks (RNN), which performs
competitively compared to language modeling and conditional random fields (CRF)
approaches. We further provide quantitative and qualitative analysis on how RNN
helps improve truecasing.
