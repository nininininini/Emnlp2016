Abstract#==#Canonical morphological segmentation aims to divide words into a sequence of
standardized segments. In this work, we propose a character-based neural
encoder-decoder model for this task. Additionally, we extend our model to
include morpheme-level and lexical information through a neural reranker. We
set the new state of the art for the task improving previous results by up to
21% accuracy. Our experiments cover three languages: English, German and
Indonesian.
