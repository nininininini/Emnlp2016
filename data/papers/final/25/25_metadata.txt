Abstract#==#Implicative verbs (e.g. "manage") entail their compliment clauses, while
non-implicative verbs (e.g. "want") do not. For example, while "managing to
solve the problem" entails "solving the problem", no such inference follows
from "wanting to solve the problem." Differentiating between implicative and
non-implicative verbs is therefore an essential component of natural language
understanding, relevant to applications such as textual entailment and
summarization. We present a simple method for predicting implicativeness which
exploits known constraints on the tense of implicative verbs and their
compliments. We show that this yields an effective, data-driven way of
capturing this nuanced property in verbs.
