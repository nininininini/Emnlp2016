Abstract#==#In this paper, we utilize distributed word representations (i.e., word
embeddings) to analyse the representation of semantics in brain activity.
The brain activity data were recorded using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) when subjects were viewing words.
First, we analysed the functional selectivity of different cortex areas by
calculating the correlations between neural responses and several types of word
representations,
including skip-gram word embeddings, visual semantic vectors, and primary
visual features.
The results demonstrated consistency with existing neuroscientific knowledge.

Second, we utilized behavioural data as the semantic ground truth to measure
their relevance with brain activity.
A method to estimate word embeddings under the constraints of brain activity
similarities is further proposed based on the semantic word embedding (SWE)
model.
The experimental results show that the brain activity data are significantly
correlated with the behavioural data of human judgements on semantic
similarity.
The correlations between the estimated word embeddings and the                       
 
semantic
ground
truth
can be effectively improved after integrating the brain activity data for
learning, which implies that semantic patterns in neural representations may
exist that have not been fully captured by state-of-the-art word embeddings
derived from text corpora.
