Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our work in emotion cause extraction. Since there is
no open
dataset available, the lack of annotated resources has limited the research in
this area.
Thus, we first present a dataset we built using SINA city news. The annotation
is based on
the scheme of the W3C Emotion Markup Language. Second, we propose a 7-tuple
definition
to describe emotion cause events. Based on this general definition, we propose
a new
event-driven emotion cause extraction method using multi-kernel SVMs where a
syntactical
tree based approach is used to represent events in text. A convolution kernel
based multi-kernel SVM are used to extract emotion causes. Because traditional
convolution
kernels do not use lexical information at the terminal nodes of syntactic
trees, we modify the kernel function with a synonym based improvement. Even
with very limited training data, we can still extract sufficient features for
the task. Evaluations show that our approach achieves 11.6% higher F-measure
compared to referenced methods. The contributions of our work include resource
construction, concept definition and algorithm development.
