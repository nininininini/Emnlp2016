Abstract#==#We describe a neural shift-reduce parsing
model for CCG, factored into four unidirectional
LSTMs and one bidirectional LSTM.
This factorization allows the linearization of
the complete parsing history, and results in
a highly accurate greedy parser that outperforms
all previous beam-search shift-reduce
parsers for CCG. By further deriving a globally
optimized model using a task-based loss,
we improve over the state of the art by up to
2.67% labeled F1.
