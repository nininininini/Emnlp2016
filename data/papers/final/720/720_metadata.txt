Abstract#==#We propose a domain adaptation framework, and formally prove that it
generalizes the feature augmentation technique in (Daume ́ III, 2007) and the
multi-task regularization framework in (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004). We show
that our framework is strictly more general than these approaches and allows
practitioners to tune hyper-parameters to encourage transfer between close
domains and avoid negative transfer between distant ones.
