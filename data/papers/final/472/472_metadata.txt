Abstract#==#The recently proposed coupled sequence labeling is shown to be able to
effectively exploit multiple labeled data with heterogeneous annotations but
suffer from severe inefficiency problem due to the large bundled tag space (Li
et al., 2015). In their case study of part-of-speech (POS) tagging,  Li et al.
(2015) manually design context-free tag-to-tag mapping rules with a lot of
effort to reduce the tag space. 

This paper proposes a context-aware pruning approach that performs token-wise
constraints on the tag space based on contextual evidences, making the coupled
approach efficient enough to be applied to the more complex task of joint word
segmentation (WS) and POS tagging for the first time. Experiments show that
using the large-scale People Daily as auxiliary heterogeneous data, the coupled
approach can improve F-score by 95.55-94.88=0.67\% on WS, and by
90.58-89.49=1.09\% on joint WS\&POS on Penn Chinese Treebank.
