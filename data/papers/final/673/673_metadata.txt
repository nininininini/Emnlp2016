Abstract#==#Transfer learning is aimed to make use of valuable knowledge in a source domain
to help model performance in a target domain. It is particularly important to
neural networks, which are very likely to be overfitting. In some fields like
image processing, many studies have shown the effectiveness of neural
network-based transfer learning. For neural NLP, however, existing studies have
only casually applied transfer learning, and conclusions are inconsistent. In
this paper, we conduct systematic case studies and provide an illuminating
picture on the transferability of neural networks in NLP.
