Abstract#==#Models of neural machine translation are often
from a discriminative family of encoderdecoders
that learn a conditional distribution
of a target sentence given a source sentence.
In this paper, we propose a variational model
to learn this conditional distribution for neural
machine translation: a variational encoderdecoder
model that can be trained end-to-end.
Different from the vanilla encoder-decoder
model that generates target translations from
hidden representations of source sentences
alone, the variational model introduces a continuous
latent variable to explicitly model underlying
semantics of source sentences and to
guide the generation of target translations. In
order to perform efficient posterior inference
and large-scale training, we build a neural
posterior approximator conditioned on both
the source and the target sides, and equip it
with a reparameterization technique to estimate
the variational lower bound. Experiments
on both Chinese-English and English-
German translation tasks show that the proposed
variational neural machine translation
achieves significant improvements over the
vanilla neural machine translation baselines.
