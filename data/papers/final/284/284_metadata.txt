Abstract#==#The problem of noisy and unbalanced training data for supervised keyphrase
extraction results from the subjectivity of keyphrase assignment, which we
quantify by crowdsourcing keyphrases for news and fashion magazine articles
with many annotators per document. We show that annotators exhibit substantial
disagreement, meaning that single annotator data could lead to very different
training sets for supervised keyphrase extractors. Thus, annotations from
single authors or readers lead to noisy training data and poor extraction
performance of the resulting supervised extractor. We provide a simple but
effective solution to still work with such data by reweighting the importance
of unlabeled candidate phrases in a two stage Positive Unlabeled Learning
setting. We show that performance of trained keyphrase extractors approximates
a classifier trained on articles labeled by multiple annotators, leading to
higher average F1 scores and better rankings of keyphrases. We apply this
strategy to a variety of test collections from different backgrounds and show
improvements over strong baseline models.
