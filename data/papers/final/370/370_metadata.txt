Abstract#==#Multiple treebanks annotated under heterogeneous standards give rise to the
research question of best utilizing multiple resources for improving
statistical models. Prior research has focused on discrete models, leveraging
stacking and multi-view learning to address the problem. In this paper, we
empirically investigate heterogeneous annotations using neural network models,
building a neural network counterpart to discrete stacking and multiview
learning, respectively, finding that neural models have their unique advantages
thanks to the freedom from manual feature engineering. Neural model achieves
not only better accuracy improvements, but also an order of magnitude faster
speed compared to its discrete baseline, adding little time cost compared to a
neural model trained on a single treebank.
