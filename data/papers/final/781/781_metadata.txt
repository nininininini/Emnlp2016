Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach to extract implicit interpretations from modal
constructions. Importantly, our approach uses a deterministic procedure to
normalize eventualities and generate potential interpretations. An annotation
effort demonstrates that these interpretations are intuitive to humans and most
modal constructions convey at least one interpretation. Experimental results
show that the task is challenging but can be automated.
