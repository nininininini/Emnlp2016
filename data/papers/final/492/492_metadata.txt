Abstract#==#We propose to enhance the RNN decoder in a neural machine translator (NMT) with
external memory, as a natural but powerful extension to the state in the
decoding RNN. This memory-enhanced RNN decoder is called \textsc{MemDec}. At
each time during decoding, \textsc{MemDec} will read from this memory and write
to this memory once, both with content-based addressing. Unlike the unbounded
memory in previous work\cite{RNNsearch} to store the representation of source
sentence, the memory in \textsc{MemDec} is a matrix with pre-determined size
designed to better capture the information important for the decoding process
at each time step. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows
that it can improve by $4.8$ BLEU upon Groundhog and $5.3$ BLEU upon on Moses,
yielding the best performance achieved with the same training set.
