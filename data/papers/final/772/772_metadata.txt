Abstract#==#Even syntactically correct sentences are perceived as awkward if they do not
contain correct punctuation. Still, the problem of automatic generation of
punctuation marks  has been  largely neglected for a long time. We present a
novel model introduces punctuation marks into raw text material using a
transition-based stack LSTM model. Unlike the state-of-the-art approaches, our 
model is language-independent and also neutral with respect to the intended use
of the punctuation. Multilingual experiments show that it achieves high
accuracy on the full range of punctuation marks across languages.
