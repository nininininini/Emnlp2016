Abstract#==#We explore the use of the orthographic syllable, a variable-length
consonant-vowel sequence, as a basic unit of translation between related
languages  which use abugida or alphabetic scripts. We show that orthographic
syllable level translation significantly outperforms models trained over other
basic units (word, morpheme and character) when training over small parallel
corpora.
