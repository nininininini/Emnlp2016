Abstract#==#This paper presents a generic approach to content selection for creating
timelines from individual history articles for which no external information
about the same topic is available. This scenario is in contrast to existing
works on timeline generation, which require the presence of a large corpus of
news articles. To identify salient events in a given history article, we
exploit lexical cues about the article's subject area, as well as time
expressions that are syntactically attached to an event word. We also test
different methods of ensuring timeline coverage of the entire historical time
span described. Our best-performing method outperforms a new unsupervised
baseline and an improved version of an existing supervised approach. We see our
work as a step towards more semantically motivated approaches to
single-document summarisation.
