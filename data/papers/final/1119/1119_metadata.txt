Abstract#==#Texts present coherent stories that have a particular theme or overall setting,
for example science fiction or westerns. In this paper, we present a text
generation method called 'rewriting' that edits existing human-authored
narratives to change their theme without changing the underlying story. We
apply the approach to math word problems, where it might help students stay
more engaged by quickly transforming all of their homework assignments to the
theme of their favorite movie without changing the math concepts that are being
taught. 
Our rewriting method uses a two-stage decoding process, which proposes new
words from the target theme and scores the resulting stories according to a
number of factors defining aspects of syntactic, semantic, and thematic
coherence.
Experiments demonstrate that the final stories typically represent the new
theme well while still testing the original math concepts, outperforming a
number of baselines. 
We also release a new dataset of human-authored rewrites of math word problems
in several themes.
