Abstract#==#For many NLP applications that require a parser, the sentences of interest may
not be well-formed. If the parser can overlook problems such as grammar
mistakes and produce a parse tree that closely resembles the correct analysis
for the intended sentence, we say that the parser is robust. This paper
compares the performances of eight state-of-the-art dependency parsers on two
domains of ungrammatical sentences: learner English and machine translation
outputs. We have developed an evaluation metric and conducted a suite of
experiments. Our analyses may help practitioners to choose an appropriate
parser for their tasks, and help developers to improve parser robustness
against ungrammatical sentences.
