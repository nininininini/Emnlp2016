Abstract#==#Within the field of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the neural
approach (NMT) has recently emerged as the first technology able to
challenge the long-standing dominance of phrase-based approaches
(PBMT). In particular, at the IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign, NMT
outperformed well established state-of-the-art PBMT systems on
English-German, a language pair known to be particularly hard because
of morphology and syntactic differences.  To understand in what
respects NMT provides better translation quality than PBMT, we
perform a detailed analysis of neural vs. phrase-based SMT outputs,
leveraging high quality post-edits performed by professional
translators on the IWSLT data. For the first time, our analysis
provides useful insights on what linguistic phenomena are best modeled
by neural models -- such as the reordering of verbs -- while pointing
out other aspects that remain to be improved.
