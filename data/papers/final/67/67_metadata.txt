Abstract#==#Exact inference in high-order graph-based non-porjective dependency parsing is
intractable.
Hence, sophisticated approximation techniques based on algorithms such as
belief
propagation and dual decomposition have been employed. In contrast, we propose
a simple
greedy search approximation for this problem which is very intuitive and easy
to implement.
We implement the algorithm within the second-order TurboParser and experiment
with the datasets of the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared task on multilingual
dependency parsing. Our algorithm improves the run time of the parser by a
factor of 1.43 while losing 1% in UAS on average across languages. Moreover, an
ensemble method exploiting the joint power of the parsers, achieves an average
UAS 0.27% higher than the TurboParser.
