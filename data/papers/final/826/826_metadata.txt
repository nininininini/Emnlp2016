Abstract#==#Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved the top performance for event
detection due to their capacity to induce the underlying structures of the
$k$-grams in the sentences. However, the current CNN-based event detectors only
model the consecutive $k$-grams and ignore the non-consecutive $k$-grams that
might involve important structures for event detection. In this work, we
propose to improve the current CNN models for ED by introducing the
non-consecutive convolution. Our systematic evaluation on both the general
setting and the domain adaptation setting demonstrates the effectiveness of the
non-consecutive CNN model, leading to the significant performance improvement
over the current state-of-the-art systems.
