Abstract#==#We investigate whether a neural, encoder-decoder translation system learns
syntactic information on the source side as a by-product of training. We
propose two methods to detect whether the encoder has learned local and global
source syntax. A fine-grained analysis of the syntactic structure learned by
the encoder reveals which kinds of syntax are learned and which are missing.
