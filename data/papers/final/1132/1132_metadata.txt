Abstract#==#We introduce a manually-created, multi-reference dataset for abstractive
sentence and short paragraph compression. First, we examine the impact of
single- and multi-sentence level editing operations on human compression
quality as found in this corpus. We observe that substitution and rephrasing
operations are more meaning preserving than other operations, and that
compressing in context improves quality. Second, we systematically explore the
correlations between automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments of
meaning preservation and grammaticality in the compression task, and analyze
the impact of the linguistic units used and precision versus recall measures on
the quality of the metrics. Multi-reference evaluation metrics are shown to
offer significant advantage over single reference-based metrics.
