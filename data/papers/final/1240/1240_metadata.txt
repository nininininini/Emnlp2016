Abstract#==#Rule-based stemmers such as the Porter stemmer are frequently used to
preprocess English corpora for topic modeling. In this work, we train and
evaluate topic models on a variety of corpora using several different stemming
algorithms. We examine several different quantitative measures of the resulting
models, including likelihood, coherence, model stability, and entropy. Despite
their frequent use in topic modeling, we find that stemmers produce no
meaningful improvement in likelihood and coherence and in fact can degrade
topic stability.
