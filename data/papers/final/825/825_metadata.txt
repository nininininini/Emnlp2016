Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised model for the discovery and clustering of latent
"personas" (characterizations of entities). Our model simultaneously clusters
documents featuring similar collections of personas. We evaluate this model on
a collection of news articles about immigration, showing that personas help
predict the coarse-grained framing annotations in the Media Frames
Corpus. We also introduce automated model selection as a fair and robust form
of evaluation.
