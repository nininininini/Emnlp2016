Abstract#==#Sluicing is an elliptical process where the majority of a question
    can go unpronounced as long as there is a salient antecedent in
    previous discourse. This paper considers the task of antecedent
    selection: finding the correct antecedent for a given case of
    sluicing. We argue that both syntactic and discourse relationships
    are important in antecedent selection, and we construct
    linguistically sophisticated features that describe the relevant
    relationships. We also define features that describe the relation
    of the content of the antecedent and the sluice type. We develop a
    linear model which achieves accuracy of 72.4\%, a substantial
    improvement over a strong manually constructed baseline.
    Feature analysis confirms that both syntactic and discourse
    features are important in antecedent selection.
