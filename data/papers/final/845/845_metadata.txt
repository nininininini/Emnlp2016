Abstract#==#We develop a novel bi-directional attention model for dependency parsing, which
learns to agree on headword predictions from the forward and backward parsing
directions.             The parsing procedure for each direction is formulated as
sequentially querying                   the memory component that stores continuous
headword embeddings. The proposed parser makes use of {\it soft} headword
embeddings, allowing the model to implicitly capture high-order parsing history
without dramatically increasing the computational complexity.               We
conduct
experiments on English, Chinese, and 12 other languages from the CoNLL 2006
shared task, showing that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
unlabeled attachment scores on 6 languages.
