Abstract#==#Unsupervised dependency parsing aims to learn a dependency grammar from text
annotated with only POS tags. Various features and inductive biases are often
used to incorporate prior knowledge into learning. One useful type of prior
information is that there exist correlations between the parameters of grammar
rules involving different POS tags. Previous work employed manually designed
features or special prior distributions to encode such information. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised dependency parsing that uses
a neural model to predict grammar rule probabilities based on distributed
representation of POS tags. The distributed representation is automatically
learned from data and captures the correlations between POS tags. Our
experiments show that our approach outperforms previous approaches utilizing
POS correlations and is competitive with recent state-of-the-art approaches on
nine different languages.
