Abstract#==#Keyphrases can provide highly condensed and valuable information that allows
users to quickly acquire the main ideas. The task of automatically extracting
them have received considerable attention in recent decades. Different from
previous studies, which are usually focused on automatically extracting
keyphrases from documents or articles, in this study, we considered the problem
of automatically extracting keyphrases from tweets. Because of the length
limitations of Twitter-like sites, the performances of existing methods usually
drop sharply.  We proposed a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model to
combine keywords and context information to perform this problem. To evaluate
the proposed method, we also constructed a large-scale dataset collected from
Twitter. The experimental results showed that the proposed method performs
significantly better than previous methods.
