Abstract#==#Many downstream NLP tasks can benefit from Open Information Extraction (Open
IE) as a semantic representation. While Open IE systems are available for
English, many other languages lack such tools. In this paper, we present a
straightforward approach for adapting PropS, a rule-based predicate-argument
analysis for English, to a new language, German. With this approach, we quickly
obtain an Open IE system for German covering 89% of the English rule set. It
yields 1.6 n-ary extractions per sentence at 60% precision, making it
comparable to systems for English and readily usable in downstream
applications.
