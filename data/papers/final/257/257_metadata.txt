Abstract#==#Opinionated expression extraction is a central problem in fine-grained
sentiment analysis. Most existing works focus on either generic subjective
expression or aspect expression extraction. However, in opinion mining, it is
often desirable to mine the aspect specific opinion expressions (or
aspectsentiment phrases) containing both the aspect and the opinion. This paper
proposes a hybrid generative-discriminative framework for extracting such
expressions. The hybrid model consists of (i) an unsupervised generative
component for modeling the semantic coherence of terms (words/phrases) based on
their collocations across different documents, and (ii) a supervised
discriminative sequence modeling component for opinion phrase extraction.
Experimental results using Amazon.com reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of
the approach that significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.
