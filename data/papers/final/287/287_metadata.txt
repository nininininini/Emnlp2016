Abstract#==#It is well-known that opinions have targets. Extracting such targets is an
important problem of opinion mining because without knowing the target of an
opinion, the opinion is of limited use. So far many algorithms have been
proposed to extract opinion targets. However, an opinion target can be an
entity or an aspect (part or attribute) of an entity. An opinion about an
entity is an opinion about the entity as a whole, while an opinion about an
aspect is just an opinion about that specific attribute or aspect of an entity.
Thus, opinion targets should be separated into entities and aspects before use
because they represent very different things about opinions. This paper
proposes a novel algorithm, called Lifelong-RL, to solve the problem based on
lifelong machine learning and relaxation labeling. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed algorithm Lifelong-RL outperforms baseline methods markedly.
