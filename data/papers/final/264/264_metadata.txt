Abstract#==#The advent of social media and its prosperity enable users to share their
opinions and views. Understanding users' emotional states might provide the
potential to create new business opportunities. Automatically identifying
users' emotional states from their texts and classifying emotions into finite
categories such as joy, anger, disgust, etc., can be considered as a text
classification problem. However, it introduces a challenging learning scenario
where multiple emotions with different intensities are often found in a single
sentence. Moreover, some emotions co-occur more often while other emotions
rarely co-exist. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on emotion
distribution learning in order to address the aforementioned issues. The key
idea is to learn a  mapping function from sentences to their emotion
distributions describing multiple emotions and their respective intensities.
Moreover, the relations of emotions are captured based on the Plutchik's wheel
of emotions and are subsequently incorporated into the learning algorithm in
order to improve the accuracy of emotion detection. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach can effectively deal with the emotion distribution
detection problem and perform remarkably better than both the state-of-the-art
emotion detection method and multi-label learning methods.
