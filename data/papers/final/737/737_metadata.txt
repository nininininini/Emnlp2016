Abstract#==#Sentiment lexicons have been leveraged as a useful source of features for
sentiment analysis models, leading to the state-of-the-art accuracies. On the
other hand, most existing methods use sentiment lexicons without considering
context, typically taking the count, sum of strength, or maximum sentiment
scores over the whole input. We propose a context-sensitive lexicon-based
method based on a simple weighted-sum model, using
a recurrent neural network to learn the sentiments strength, intensification
and negation of lexicon sentiments in composing the sentiment value of
sentences. Results show that our model can not only learn such operation
details, but also give significant improvements over state-of-the-art recurrent
neural network baselines without lexical features, achieving the best results
on a Twitter benchmark.
