Abstract#==#With the renaissance of neural network in recent years, relation classification
has again become a research hotspot in natural language processing, and
leveraging parse trees is a common and effective method of tackling this
problem. In this work, we offer a new perspective on utilizing syntactic
information of dependency parse tree and present a position encoding
convolutional neural network (PECNN) based on dependency parse tree for
relation classification. First, tree-based position features are proposed to
encode the relative positions of words in dependency trees and help enhance the
word representations. Then, based on a redefinition of "context", we design two
kinds of tree-based convolution kernels for capturing the semantic and
structural information provided by dependency trees. Finally, the features
extracted by convolution module are fed to a classifier for labelling the
semantic relations. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that PECNN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We also compare the effect of
different position features and visualize the influence of tree-based position
feature by tracing back the convolution process.
