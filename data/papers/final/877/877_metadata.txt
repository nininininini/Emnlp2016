Abstract#==#Recently, there is rising interest in modelling the interactions of two
sentences with deep neural networks. However, most of the existing methods
encode two sequences with separate encoders, in which a sentence is encoded
with little or no information from the other sentence. In this paper, we
propose a deep architecture to model the strong  interaction of sentence pair
with two coupled-LSTMs. Specifically, we introduce two coupled ways to model
the interdependences of two LSTMs, coupling the local contextualized
interactions of two sentences. We then aggregate these interactions and use a
dynamic pooling to select the most informative features. Experiments on two
very large datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architectures.
