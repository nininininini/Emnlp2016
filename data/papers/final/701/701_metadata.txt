Abstract#==#Semantic error detection and correction is an important task for applications
such as fact checking, speech-to-text or grammatical error correction.
Current approaches generally focus on relatively shallow semantics and do not
account for numeric quantities.
Our approach uses language models grounded on numbers within the text. Such
groundings are easily achieved for recurrent neural language model
architectures, which can be further conditioned on incomplete background
knowledge bases.
Our evaluation on clinical reports shows that numerical grounding improves
perplexity by 33% and F1 for semantic error correction by 5 points when
compared to ungrounded approaches. Conditioning on a knowledge base yields
further improvements.
