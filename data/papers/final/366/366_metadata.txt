Abstract#==#This paper introduces a neural model for concept-to-text generation that scales
to large, rich domains. It generates biographical sentences from fact tables on
a new dataset of biographies from Wikipedia. This set is an order of magnitude
larger than existing resources with over 700k samples and a 400k vocabulary.
Our model builds on conditional neural language models for text generation. To
deal with the large vocabulary, we extend these models to mix a fixed
vocabulary with copy actions that transfer sample-specific words from the input
database to the generated output sentence. To deal with structured data, we
allow the model to embed words differently depending on the data fields in
which they occur. Our neural model significantly outperforms a Templated
Kneser-Ney language model by nearly 15 BLEU.
