Abstract#==#This paper demonstrates that it is possible for a parser to improve its
performance with a human in the loop, by posing simple questions to
non-experts. For example, given the first sentence of this abstract, if the
parser is uncertain about the subject of the verb “pose,” it could generate
the question What would pose something? with candidate answers this paper and a
parser. Any fluent speaker can answer this question, and the correct answer
resolves the original uncertainty. We apply the approach to a CCG parser,
converting uncertain attachment decisions into natural language questions about
the arguments of verbs. Experiments show that crowd workers can answer these
questions quickly, accurately and cheaply. Our human-in-the-loop parser
improves on the state of the art with less than 2 questions per sentence on
average, with a gain of 1.7 F1 on the 10% of sentences whose parses are
changed.
