Abstract#==#Structural isomorphism between languages benefits the performance of
cross-lingual applications. We propose an automatic algorithm for cross-lingual
similarization of dependency grammars, which automatically learns grammars with
high cross-lingual similarity. The algorithm similarizes the annotation styles
of the dependency grammars for two languages in the level of classification
decisions, and gradually improves the cross-lingual similarity without losing
linguistic knowledge resorting to iterative cross-lingual cooperative learning.
The dependency grammars given by cross-lingual similarization have much higher
cross-lingual similarity while maintaining non-triviality. As applications, the
cross-lingually similarized grammars significantly improve the performance of
dependency tree-based machine translation.
