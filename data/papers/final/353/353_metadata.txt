Abstract#==#Regularization is a critical step in supervised learning to not only address
overfitting, but also to take into account any prior knowledge we may have on
the features and their dependence. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art
structured regularizers and we propose novel ones based on clusters of words
from LSI topics, word2vec embeddings and graph-of-words document
representation. We show that our proposed regularizers are faster than the
state-of-the-art ones and still improve text classification accuracy.
