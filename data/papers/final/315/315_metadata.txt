Abstract#==#We explore linguistic and behavioral features of dogmatism in social media and
construct statistical models that can identify dogmatic comments. Our model is
based on a corpus of Reddit posts, collected across a diverse set of
conversational topics and annotated via paid crowdsourcing. We operationalize
key aspects of dogmatism described by existing psychology theories (such as
over-confidence), finding they have predictive power. We also find evidence for
new signals of dogmatism, such as the tendency of dogmatic posts to refrain
from signaling cognitive processes. When we use our predictive model to analyze
millions of other Reddit posts, we find evidence that suggests dogmatism is a
deeper personality trait, present for dogmatic users across many different
domains, and that users who engage on dogmatic comments tend to show increases
in dogmatic posts themselves.
