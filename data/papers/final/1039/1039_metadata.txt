Abstract#==#Though dialectal language is increasingly abundant on social media, few
resources exist for developing NLP tools to handle such language. We conduct a
case study of dialectal language in online conversational text by investigating
African-American English (AAE) on Twitter. We propose a distantly supervised
model to identify AAE-like language from demographics associated with
geo-located messages, and we verify that this language follows well-known AAE
linguistic phenomena. In addition, we analyze the quality of existing language
identification and dependency parsing tools on AAE-like text, demonstrating
that they perform poorly on such text compared to text associated with white
speakers. We also provide an ensemble classifier for language identification
which eliminates this disparity and release a new corpus of tweets containing
AAE-like language.
