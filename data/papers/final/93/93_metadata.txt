Abstract#==#Language resources that systematically organize paraphrases for binary
relations are of great value for various NLP tasks and have recently been
advanced in projects like PATTY, WiseNet and DEFIE. 
This paper presents a new method for building such a resource and the resource
itself, called POLY.
Starting with a very large collection of multilingual sentences parsed into
triples of phrases, our method clusters relational phrases using probabilistic
measures. 
We judiciously leverage fine-grained semantic typing of relational arguments
for identifying synonymous phrases. 
The evaluation of POLY shows significant improvements in precision and recall
over the prior works on PATTY and DEFIE.
An extrinsic use case demonstrates the benefits of POLY for question answering.
