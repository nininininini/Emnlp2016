Abstract#==#The PPDB is an automatically built database which contains millions of
paraphrases in different languages. Paraphrases in this resource are associated
with features that serve to their ranking and reflect paraphrase quality. This
context-unaware ranking captures the semantic similarity of paraphrases but
cannot serve to estimate their adequacy in specific contexts. We propose to use
vector-space semantic models for selecting PPDB paraphrases that preserve the
meaning of specific text fragments. This is the first work that addresses the
substitutability of PPDB paraphrases in context. We show that vector-space
models of meaning can be successfully applied to this task and increase the
benefit brought by the use of the PPDB resource in applications.
