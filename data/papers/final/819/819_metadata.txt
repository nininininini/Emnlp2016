Abstract#==#Text reuse refers to citing, copying or alluding
text excerpts from a text resource to a
new context. While detecting reuse in contemporary
languages is well supported—given
extensive research, techniques, and corpora—
automatically detecting historical text reuse is
much more difficult. Corpora of historical languages
are less documented and often encompass
various genres, linguistic varieties, and
topics. In fact, historical text reuse detection is
much less understood and empirical studies are
necessary to enable and improve its automation.
We present a linguistic analysis of text reuse in
two ancient data sets. We contribute an automated
approach to analyze how an original text
was transformed into its reuse, taking linguistic
resources into account to understand how
they help characterizing the transformation. It
is complemented by a manual analysis of a
subset of the reuse. Our results show the limitations
of approaches focusing on literal reuse
detection. Yet, linguistic resources can effectively
support understanding the non-literal text
reuse transformation process. Our results support
practitioners and researchers working on
understanding and detecting historical reuse.
