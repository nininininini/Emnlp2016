Abstract#==#Regulating deep neural networks (DNNs) with human structured knowledge has
shown to be of great benefit for improved accuracy and interpretability. We
develop a general framework that enables learning knowledge and its confidence
jointly with the DNNs, so that the vast amount of fuzzy knowledge can be
incorporated and automatically optimized with little manual efforts. We apply
the framework to sentence sentiment analysis, augmenting a DNN with massive
linguistic constraints on discourse and polarity structures. Our model
substantially enhances the performance using less training data, and shows
improved interpretability. The principled framework can also be applied to
posterior regularization for regulating other statistical models.
