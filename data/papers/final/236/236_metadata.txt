Abstract#==#Embedding words in a vector space has gained a lot of attention in recent
years. While state-of-the-art methods provide efficient computation of word
similarities via a low-dimensional matrix embedding, their motivation is often
left unclear. In this paper, we argue that word embedding can be naturally
viewed as a ranking problem due to the ranking nature of the evaluation
metrics. Then, based on this insight, we propose a novel framework WordRank
that efficiently estimates word representations via robust ranking, in which
the attention mechanism and robustness to noise are readily achieved via the
DCG-like ranking losses. The performance of WordRank is measured in word
similarity and word analogy benchmarks, and the results are compared to the
state-of-the-art word embedding techniques. Our algorithm is very competitive
to the state-of-the-arts on large corpora, while outperforms them by a
significant margin when the training set is limited (i.e., sparse
and noisy). With 17 million tokens, WordRank performs almost as well as
existing methods using 7.2 billion tokens on a popular word similarity
benchmark. Our multi-node distributed
implementation of WordRank is publicly available for general usage.
