Abstract#==#Speculation and negation are important in-formation to identify text
factuality. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)-based model with probabil-istic weighted average pooling to address
speculation and negation scope detection. In particular, our CNN-based model
extracts those meaningful features from various syn-tactic paths between the
cues and the candi-date tokens in both constituency and depen-dency parse
trees. Evaluation on BioScope shows that our CNN-based model significant-ly
outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on Abstracts, a sub-corpus in
BioScope, and achieves comparable performances on Clini-cal Records, another
sub-corpus in BioScope.
