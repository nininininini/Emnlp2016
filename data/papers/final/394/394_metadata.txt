Abstract#==#Sequence labeling is a widely used method for named entity recognition and
information extraction from unstructured natural language data. In the clinical
domain one major application of sequence labeling involves extraction of
relevant entities such as medication, indication, and side-effects from
Electronic Health Record Narratives. Sequence labeling in this domain presents
its own set of challenges and objectives. In this work we experiment with
Conditional Random Field based structured learning models with Recurrent Neural
Networks. We extend the previously studied CRF-LSTM model with explicit
modeling of pairwise potentials. We also propose an approximate version of
skip-chain CRF inference with RNN potentials. We use these methods for
structured prediction in order to improve the exact phrase detection of
clinical entities.
