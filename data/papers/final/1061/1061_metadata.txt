Abstract#==#We investigate mutual benefits between syntax  and  semantic  roles  using 
neural network models, by studying a parsing-->SRL pipeline, a SRL-->parsing 
pipeline,  and a  simple  joint model by embedding  sharing.  
The integration of syntactic and semantic features gives promising results in a
Chinese Semantic Tree-bank, demonstrating large potentials of neural models for
joint parsing and semantic role labeling.
