Abstract#==#Recently, neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment
classification due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. However,
one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in document-level
sentiment classification under a recurrent architecture because of the
deficiency of the memory unit.
To address this problem, we present a Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural
networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts.
CLSTM introduces a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups
with different forgetting rates and thus enables the network to keep sentiment
information better within a recurrent unit. The proposed CLSTM outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on three publicly available document-level sentiment
analysis datasets.
