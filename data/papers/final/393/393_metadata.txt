Abstract#==#This paper presents a two-step procedure to extract positive meaning from
verbal negation. We first generate potential positive interpretations
manipulating syntactic dependencies. Then, we score them according to their
likelihood. Manual annotations show that positive interpretations are
ubiquitous and intuitive to humans. Experimental results show that dependencies
are better suited than semantic roles for this task, and automation is
possible.
