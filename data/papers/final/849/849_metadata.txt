Abstract#==#We present a probabilistic model of the influence of language on the behavior
of the U.S.~Supreme Court, specifically influence of amicus briefs on Court
decisions and opinions. The approach assumes that amici are rational,
utility-maximizing agents who try to win votes or affect the language of court
opinions.  Our model leads to improved predictions of justices' votes and
perplexity of opinion language. It is amenable to inspection, allowing us to
explore inferences about the persuasiveness of different amici and
influenceability of different justices; these are consistent with earlier
findings.
