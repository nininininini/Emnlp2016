Abstract#==#Previous work on automatic summarization does not thoroughly consider coherence
while
generating the summary. We introduce a graph-based approach to summarize
scientific
articles. We employ coherence patterns to ensure that the generated summaries
are coherent. The novelty of our model is twofold: we mine coherence patterns
in a corpus of abstracts, and we propose a method to combine coherence,
importance and non-redundancy to
generate the summary. We optimize these factors simultaneously using Mixed
Integer Pro-
gramming. Our approach significantly outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art
systems in
terms of coherence (summary coherence assessment) and relevance (ROUGE scores).
