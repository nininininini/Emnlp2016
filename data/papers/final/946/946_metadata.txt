Abstract#==#Technical writing in professional environments, such as user manual authoring,
requires the use of uniform language. Non-uniform language detection is a novel
task, which aims to guarantee the consistency for technical writing by
detecting sentences in a document that are intended to have the same meaning
within a similar context but use different words or writing style. This paper
proposes an approach that utilizes text similarity algorithms at lexical,
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels. Different features are extracted and
integrated by applying a machine learning classification method. We tested our
method using smart phone user manuals, and compared its performance against the
state-of-the-art methods in a related area. The experiments demonstrate that
our approach  achieves the upper bound performance for this task.
