Abstract#==#In our study, we focus on synthetic understanding of documents: specifically
reading comprehension (RC). A current problem in RC is the need for a method to
analyze RC system performance to enable further development.
  We therefore propose a methodology that enables the examination of RC systems
in multiple aspects. 
Our methodology consists of three steps. We first define a set of basic skills
used in RC.
Next, we manually annotate questions of an existing RC task. Finally, for each
skill, we show the performances of existing systems that have been proposed for
each task.
In this summary, we exemplify the proposed methodology by annotating MCTest
(Richardson et al., 2013). The results of the annotation show that answering RC
questions requires combinations of multiple skills. They additionally show that
our RC skills are useful and promising for decomposing and analyzing the RC
process.
