Abstract#==#Representing the underlying meaning of text has been a long-standing topic of
interest in computational linguistics. Recently there has been a renewed
interest in computational modeling of meaning for various tasks such as
semantic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Berant and Liang, 2014). Open domain
and broad-coverage semantic representation (Banarescu et al., 2013; Bos, 2008;
Allen et al., 2008) is required for many language understanding tasks such as
reading comprehension tests and question answering. We work on deÔ¨Åning a
joint framework for comprehensive semantic representation of the structure of
comparison and ellipsis structures in language.
