Abstract#==#We present the problem of "bringing text to life" via 3D interactive
storytelling, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to
transform narrative text into events in a virtual world that the user can
interact with. This is a challenging problem, which requires deep understanding
of the semantics of a story and the ability to ground those semantic elements
to the actors and events of the 3D world's graphical engine. We show how this
problem has motivated interesting extensions to some classic NLP tasks,
identify some of the key lessons learned from the work so far, and propose some
future research directions.
