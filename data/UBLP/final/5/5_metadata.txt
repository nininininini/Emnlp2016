Abstract#==#This paper introduces a deceptively simple entity extraction task
intended to encourage more interdisciplinary collaboration between
fields that don't normally work together: diarization, dialog and
entity extraction.  Given a corpus of 1.4M call center calls, extract
mentions of trouble ticket numbers.  The task is challenging because
first mentions need to be distinguished from confirmations to avoid
undesirable repetitions.  It is common for agents to say part of the
ticket number, and customers confirm with a repetition.  There are
opportunities for dialog (given/new) and diarization (who said what)
to help remove repetitions.  New information is spoken slowly by
one side of a conversation; confirmations are spoken more quickly
by the other side of the conversation.
