Abstract#==#We introduce a novel approach for detecting and resolving coreference for
abstract words. Our approach is completely unsupervised and we also present a
new dataset for Biomedical Language Processing which has about ~25% of the
original corpus vocabulary but still manages to capture the distributional
semantic nature of the corpus. Our experiments show that Neural Network models
perform much better (~20% more accurate) than the traditional feature-rich
baseline models for finding abstract coreferences in biomedical text.
