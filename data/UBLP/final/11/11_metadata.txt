Abstract#==#Linguistic style conveys the social context in which communication occurs and
defines particular ways of using language to engage with the audiences to which
the text is accessible. In this work, we are interested in the task of
stylistic transfer in natural language generation (NLG) systems, which could
have applications in the dissemination of knowledge across styles, automatic
summarization and author obfuscation. The main challenges in this task involve
the lack of parallel training data and the difficulty in using stylistic
features to control generation. To address these challenges, we plan to
investigate neural network approaches to NLG to automatically learn and
incorporate stylistic features in the process of language generation. We
identify several evaluation criteria, and propose manual and automatic
evaluation approaches.
