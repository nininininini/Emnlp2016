Abstract#==#This paper describes a new spoken dialog portal that connects systems produced
by the spoken dialog research community and gives them access to real users. We
introduce a prototype dialog framework that affords easy integration with
various remote dialog agents as well as external knowledge resources. To date,
the DialPort portal has successfully connected to two dialog systems and
several public knowledge APIs. We present current progress and envision our
future plan.
