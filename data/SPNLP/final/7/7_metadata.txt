Abstract#==#We propose a multi-task learning objective for training joint structured
prediction models when no jointly annotated data is available. We use
conditional random fields as the joint predictive model and train their
parameters by optimizing the marginal likelihood of all available annotations,
with additional posterior constraints on the distributions of the latent
variables imposed to enforce agreement.
Experiments on named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging show that
the proposed model outperforms independent task estimation, and the posterior
constraints provide a useful mechanism for incorporating domain-specific
knowledge.
