Abstract#==#In Rhetorical Structure Theory, discourse units participate in asymmetric
relationships, with one element acting as the nucleus and the other as the
satellite. In the resulting tree-like nuclearity structure, the importance of
each discourse unit can be measured by the number of relations in which it acts
as the nucleus or as the satellite. Existing approaches to automatically
parsing such structures suffer from two problems: they employ local inference
techniques that do not capture document-level structural regularities, and they
rely on annotated training data, which is expensive to obtain at the discourse
level. We investigate the SampleRank structure learning algorithm as a
potential solution to both problems. SampleRank allows us to incorporate
arbitrary document-level features in a global stochastic inference algorithm.
Furthermore, it enables the training of a joint model of discourse structure
and summarization, which can be learned from document-level summaries alone,
without discourse-level supervision. We obtain mixed results in the fully
supervised case, and negative results for the joint model of discourse
structure and summarization.
