Abstract#==#Global features have proven effective in a wide range of structured prediction
problems but come with high inference costs. Imitation learning is a common
method for training models when exact inference isnâ€™t feasible. We study
imitation learning for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and analyze the
effectiveness of the Violation Fixing Perceptron (VFP) (Huang et al., 2012) and
Locally Optimal Learning to Search (LOLS) (Chang et al., 2015) frameworks with
respect to SRL global features. We describe problems in applying each framework
to SRL and evaluate the effectiveness of some solutions. We also show that
action ordering, including easy first inference, has a large impact on the
quality of greedy global models.
