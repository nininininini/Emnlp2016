Abstract#==#A probabilistic or weighted grammar implies a posterior probability
distribution over possible parses of a given input sentence.  One often needs
to extract information from this distribution, by computing the expected counts
(in the unknown parse) of various grammar rules, constituents, transitions, or
states.  This requires an algorithm such as inside-outside or forward-backward
that is tailored to the grammar formalism.  Conveniently, each such algorithm
can be obtained by automatically differentiating an ``inside''                       
     

algorithm
that
merely computes the log-probability of the evidence (the sentence).  This
mechanical procedure produces correct and efficient code.  As for any other
instance of back-propagation, it can be carried out manually or by software. 
This pedagogical paper carefully spells out the construction and relates it to
traditional and non-traditional views of these algorithms.
