Abstract#==#Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamentally important task in natural
language processing that has many applications. It is concerned with
classifying the logical relation between two sentences. In this paper, we
propose attention memory networks (AMNs) to recognize entailment and
contradiction between two sentences. In our model, an attention memory neural
network (AMNN) has a variable sized encoding memory and supports semantic
compositionality. AMNN captures sentence level semantics and reasons relation
between the sentence pairs; then we use a Sparsemax layer over the output of
the generated matching vectors (sentences) for classification. Our experiments
on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus show that our model
outperforms the state of the art, achieving an accuracy of 87.4% on the test
data.
