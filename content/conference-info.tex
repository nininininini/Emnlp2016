Welcome to the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016) in Austin, Texas, USA!

EMNLP is annually organized by SIGDAT, the Association for Computational
Linguistics' special interest group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP. At EMNLP 2016, one of the top tier conferences in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we have witnessed how our field thrives. This is not only reflected on the number of paper submissions but also the number of sponsors. The number of long paper submissions has increased 14.5\% over that of 2015. This year, we also have seen a record high number of sponsors in EMNLP history. We're honored and grateful to have Amazon, Baidu, Google and Grammarly as the Platinum Sponsors, Bloomberg, Citadel, eBay, Facebook, IBM Research, Maluuba and Microsoft as the Gold Sponsors, AI@ISI as the Silver Sponsor, Nuance, VoiceBox and Yandex as the Bronze Sponsors. We also have Oracle as the Student Volunteer Sponsor. Further more, we're expecting a record attendance. 

A large number of people worked hard to bring this annual meeting to fruition, to whom I'm very grateful. Program Chairs, {\bf Kevin Duh} and {\bf Xavier Carreras}, the Area Chairs, reviewers, best paper committee members put immense amount of work to develop the technical program. Tutorial Chairs, {\bf Bishan Yang} and {\bf Rebecca Hwa}, Workshop Chairs, {\bf Annie Louis} and {\bf Greg Kondrak} conducted a competitive selection process in collaboration with NAACL and ACL to select 6 tutorials and 8 workshops. Sponsorship Chairs, {\bf Michel Galley}, {\bf Hang Li} (ACL International Sponsorship Committee Representative for EMNLP) did an excellent job to attract the record number of sponsors. Publication Chairs, {\bf Siddharth Patwardhan},{\bf Daniele Pighin}(advisor), Handbook Chair, {\bf Swapna Somasundaran} worked in very tight schedule to assemble the proceedings, C4Me Mobile app and handbooks. Publicity Chair, {\bf Saif M. Mohammad} disseminated the call for papers, call for participation and other announcements in a timely manner. Webmaster, {\bf Jackie C.K. Cheung} kept the website updated all the time, providing a professional outlook of the conference. Student Scholarship Chair and Student Volunteer Coordinator, {\bf Vincent Ng}, played two critical roles, managing the NSF and SIGDAT scholarship, and the review of applications, coordinating the student volunteers to support the conference. SIGDAT Secretary, {\bf Chris Callison-Burch} acted as the liaison between SIGDAT and the conference organizers. He is always available to provide good suggestions. 

As usual, the conference cannot be done without Local Arrangements Chair, {\bf Priscilla Rasmussen}, who single-handedly took care of all conference logistics. I would like to mention that I benefited from last year's General Chair, {\bf Lluís Màrquez}, for the monthly progress reports and other sharing.  We are also grateful to the invited speakers, {\bf Christopher Potts}, {\bf Andreas Stolcke} and {\bf Stefanie Tellex} who will share with us their exciting research.

I really appreciate the trust from SIGDAT officers, including previous secretary, {\bf Noah Smith} for me to coordinate the conference as the General Chair. 

Finally, I'd like to thank all the authors and attendees. Your participation made a difference to the conference. I hope that you have an enjoyable and productive time at Austin. My best wishes for a success conference!

Welcome to the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing!
This year we received 1,087 valid submissions, of which 687 were long
papers and 400 were short papers.
%\footnote{By the submission deadline we received 1,185 papers, but to compute the acceptance statistics we exclude 57 papers that were withdrawn (34 long and 23 short), and
%  41 papers that were rejected without review due to a violation of
 % the submission instructions (26 long and 15 short).}
We accepted 177 long papers (25.8\% acceptance rate) and 
87 short papers (21.8\% acceptance rate), for a total of 
264 papers and an overall acceptance rate of 24.3\%.

The technical program at EMNLP 2016 consists of a total of 273 papers, including 9 journal papers accepted by the Transactions of ACL. 
We have structured the conference into three parallel oral sessions in the day and two poster sessions in the evening. 
%% KD: I've simplified this paragraph a bit. I think we don't need to be so detailed. The following text is kept in case you want to revert
%As in past editions, we have structured the
%conference into oral and poster sessions (109 papers get an oral talk,
%and the rest get poster presentations).
%
%As usual, the conference will run for three days. Each day will start
%with an invited talk, followed by parallel sessions for oral
%presentations (with three sessions in parallel). A plenary session
%featuring four best papers will conclude the conference. Posters will
%be presented in the evening of the first two days, with roughly 50
%``long'' posters and 33 ``short'' posters each evening. 
Borrowing from
recent NAACL conference innovations, we also run poster spotlight sessions (also called \emph{HMM: Half-Minute Madness}\footnote{Neologism coined by Joel Tetreault, our HMM chair.}), where poster presenters of long papers have 30 seconds and one slide to advertise their work. Poster sessions are becoming larger due to the rapid growth in our field, and we believe it 
is important to ensure that all papers receive the exposure they deserve. 

We are excited and grateful to have three distinguished speakers for our invited keynote talks. Christopher Potts (Stanford University) will present recent advances in rational speech acts and pragmatics. Andreas Stolcke (Microsoft Research) will talk about the challenges and opportunities in human-human-machine dialog. Stefanie Tellex (Brown University) will discuss novel methods and frameworks for enabling human-robot collaboration. We think that these are exciting research areas that can potentially impact---and be impacted by---the EMNLP community in the near future. We look forward to their keynotes and the conversations afterwards. 






% START reports 873 total users
% Special users: PC (2) + ACs (41) + Pub Chairs (2, they're not reviewers) + TACL user (1) : 46 special users
% Other: KevinTmp DuhTmp + Yoav Artzi has a duplicate; total other: 2
% Jian does not have a user
% Thus, there are 873-46-2=825 reviewers

% Version 2
% The committe spreadsheet from START has 871 records
% The first line is the header
% 45 records have some manager role: cat committee-2016-10-06.tsv | awk '{print $3, $4, $11, $12}' FS='\t' | grep 'Yes' | wc
% including: PC (2) + AC (41) + Sid + TACL User = 45
% 2 records do not have manager role: Daniele Pighin (pub chair) and KevinTmp
% Thus 871-1-45-2 = 823

%The program committee consisted of 864 members: 823 reviewers, 41
%area chairs, and ourselves. In addition, 100 people served as secondary
%reviewers. 
The program committee includes 823 primary reviewers and 99 secondary reviewers. 
The committee was structured into 12 thematic areas, handled by 41 area chairs. We are
grateful to all program committee members for their effort and dedication during our tight reviewing schedule; without them we cannot create a strong high-quality program. 
We are also thankful for all authors who submitted papers, which overall cover a diverse range of topics. 



Best paper awards were organized around three categories: best 
paper, best short paper, and best resource paper. The latter category
was introduced at EMNLP 2015. Since resources have become central for
scientific progress in our field, we would like this category of award
to become a standard. The selection process was bottom-up: reviewers
and area chairs suggested candidates, which were short-listed by us program chairs. 
Then, for each category we created a
committee of experts to discuss the papers in depth, and we chaired the committees. 

For {\bf best paper}, the committee members were Stephen Clark, Hal
Daum\'{e} III, Chris Dyer, and Julia Hockenmaier. The committee selected
two best long papers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Paper: \emph{Improving Information Extraction by Acquiring External Evidence with Reinforcement Learning}, by Karthik Narasimhan, Adam Yala and Regina Barzilay.
\item Best Paper: \emph{Global Neural CCG Parsing with Optimality
  Guarantees}, by Kenton Lee, Mike Lewis and Luke Zettlemoyer.
\end{itemize}
In addition, two papers were given an honorable mention for best paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Honorable Mention for Best Paper: \emph{Span-Based Constituency Parsing with a Structure-Label System and Provably Optimal Dynamic Oracles}, by James Cross and Liang Huang.
\item Honorable Mention for Best Paper: \emph{Sequence-to-Sequence
  Learning as Beam-Search Optimization}, by Sam Wiseman and Alexander
  M. Rush.
\end{itemize}
