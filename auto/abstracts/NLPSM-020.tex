This paper presents a system for classifying disaster-related tweets. The focus is on Twitter data generated before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy, which impacted New York in the fall of 2012. We propose an annotation schema for identifying relevant tweets as well as the more fine-grained categories they represent, and develop feature-rich classifiers for relevance and fine-grained categorization.
