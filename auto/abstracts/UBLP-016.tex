Representing the underlying meaning of text has been a long-standing topic of interest in computational linguistics. Recently there has been a renewed interest in computational modeling of meaning for various tasks such as semantic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Berant and Liang, 2014). Open domain and broad-coverage semantic representation (Banarescu et al., 2013; Bos, 2008; Allen et al., 2008) is required for many language understanding tasks such as reading comprehension tests and question answering. We work on defining a joint framework for comprehensive semantic representation of the structure of comparison and ellipsis structures in language.
