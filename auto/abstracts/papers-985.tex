Determining whether a major societal event has already happened, is still on-going, or may occur in the future is crucial for event prediction, timeline generation, and news summarization. We introduce a new task and a new corpus, EventStatus, which has 4500 English and Spanish articles about civil unrest events labeled as PAST, ON-GOING, or FUTURE. We show that the temporal status of these events is difficult to classify because local tense and aspect cues are often lacking, time expressions are insufficient, and the linguistic contexts have rich semantic compositionality. We explore two approaches for event status classification: (1) a feature-based SVM classifier augmented with a novel induced lexicon of future-oriented verbs, such as ``threatened'' and ``planned'', and (2) a convolutional neural net. Both types of classifiers improve event status recognition over a state-of-the-art TempEval model, and our analysis offers linguistic insights into the semantic compositionality challenges for this new task.
