Social scientists who do not have specialized natural language processing training often use a unigram bag-of-words (BOW) representation when analyzing text corpora. We offer a new phrase-based method, NPFST, for enriching a unigram BOW. NPFST uses a part-of-speech tagger and a finite state transducer to extract multiword phrases to be added to a unigram BOW. We compare NPFST to both n-gram and parsing methods in terms of yield, recall, and efficiency. We then demonstrate how to use NPFST for exploratory analyses; it performs well, without configuration, on many different kinds of English text. Finally, we present a case study using NPFST to analyze a new corpus of U.S. congressional bills. For our open-source implementation, see http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/phrases/.
