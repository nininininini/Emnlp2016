Computational social science is, at its core, a blending of disciplines - the best of human experience, judgement, and anecdotal case studies fused with novel computational methods to extract subtle patterns from immense data. Jointly leveraging such diverse approaches effectively is decidedly nontrivial, but with tremendous potential benefits. We provide frank assessments from our work bridging the computational linguistics and psychology communities during a range of short and long-term engagements, in the hope that these assessments might provide a foundation upon which those embarking on novel computational social science projects might structure their interactions.
