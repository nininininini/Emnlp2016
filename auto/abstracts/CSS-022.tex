This paper presents a novel method for user profiling in social media that makes use of geo-location information associated with social media posts to avoid the need for self-reported data. These posts are combined with two publicly available sources of demographic information to automatically create data sets in which posts are labelled with socio-economic status. The data sets are linked by identifying each user's `home location'. Analysis indicates that the nature of the demographic information is an important factor in performance of this approach.
