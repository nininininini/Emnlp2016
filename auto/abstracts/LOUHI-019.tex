ICD-10 coding of death certificates has received renewed attention recently with the organization of the CLEF eHealth 2016 clinical information extraction task (CLEF eHealth 2016 Task 2).  This task has been addressed either with dictionary projection methods or with supervised machine learning methods, but none of the participants have tried to design hybrid methods to process these data. The goal of the present paper is to explore such hybrid methods. It proposes several hybrid methods which outperform both plain dictionary projection and supervised machine learning on the training set. On the official test set, it obtains an F-measure of 0.8586 which is 1pt above the best published results so far on this corpus (p<0.0001).  Moreover, it does so with no manual dictionary tuning, and thus has potential for generalization to other languages with little effort.
