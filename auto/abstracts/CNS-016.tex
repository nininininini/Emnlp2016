Abstract: Two contrasting paradigms for structuring news events and storylines are identified and described: the automated paradigm and the manual paradigm. A specific manual news structuring system is described, and the high level results of three reporting experiments conducted using the system are presented. In light of these results I then compare automated and manual approaches and argue that they are complementary. A proposal for integrating automated and manual techniques within a structured news ecosystem is presented, and recommendations for integrated approaches are provided.
