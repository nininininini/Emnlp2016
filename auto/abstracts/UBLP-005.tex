This paper introduces a deceptively simple entity extraction task intended to encourage more interdisciplinary collaboration between fields that don't normally work together: diarization, dialog and entity extraction.  Given a corpus of 1.4M call center calls, extract mentions of trouble ticket numbers.  The task is challenging because first mentions need to be distinguished from confirmations to avoid undesirable repetitions.  It is common for agents to say part of the ticket number, and customers confirm with a repetition.  There are opportunities for dialog (given/new) and diarization (who said what) to help remove repetitions.  New information is spoken slowly by one side of a conversation; confirmations are spoken more quickly by the other side of the conversation.
