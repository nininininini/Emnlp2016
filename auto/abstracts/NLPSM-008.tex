Depression is a major threat to public health, accounting for almost 12\% of all disabilities and claiming the life of one out of every five patients suffering from it. Since depression is often signaled by decreasing social interaction, we explored how analysis of online health forums may help identify such episodes. We collected posts and replies from users of several forums on healthboards.com and analyzed changes in their use of language and activity levels over time. We found revealing phrases that are associated with final posts in a Depression forum (e.g. cut myself), and that users of a Depression forum use many fewer social words as compared to users of related forums like Relationship Health or Brain/Nervous System Disorder. We explored building models based on these findings, and achieved 94.05 F1 for detecting users who will withdraw from a Depression forum by the end of a 1-year observation period.
