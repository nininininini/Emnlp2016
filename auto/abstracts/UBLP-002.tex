In our study, we focus on synthetic understanding of documents: specifically reading comprehension (RC). A current problem in RC is the need for a method to analyze RC system performance to enable further development. We therefore propose a methodology that enables the examination of RC systems in multiple aspects. Our methodology consists of three steps. We first define a set of basic skills used in RC. Next, we manually annotate questions of an existing RC task. Finally, for each skill, we show the performances of existing systems that have been proposed for each task. In this summary, we exemplify the proposed methodology by annotating MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013). The results of the annotation show that answering RC questions requires combinations of multiple skills. They additionally show that our RC skills are useful and promising for decomposing and analyzing the RC process.
