Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamentally important task in natural language processing that has many applications. It is concerned with classifying the logical relation between two sentences. In this paper, we propose attention memory networks (AMNs) to recognize entailment and contradiction between two sentences. In our model, an attention memory neural network (AMNN) has a variable sized encoding memory and supports semantic compositionality. AMNN captures sentence level semantics and reasons relation between the sentence pairs; then we use a Sparsemax layer over the output of the generated matching vectors (sentences) for classification. Our experiments on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus show that our model outperforms the state of the art, achieving an accuracy of 87.4\% on the test data.
