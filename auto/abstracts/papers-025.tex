Implicative verbs (e.g. ``manage'') entail their compliment clauses, while non-implicative verbs (e.g. ``want'') do not. For example, while ``managing to solve the problem'' entails ``solving the problem'', no such inference follows from ``wanting to solve the problem.'' Differentiating between implicative and non-implicative verbs is therefore an essential component of natural language understanding, relevant to applications such as textual entailment and summarization. We present a simple method for predicting implicativeness which exploits known constraints on the tense of implicative verbs and their compliments. We show that this yields an effective, data-driven way of capturing this nuanced property in verbs.
