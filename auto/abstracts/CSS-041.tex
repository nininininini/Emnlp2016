We present a corpus for protest event mining that combines token-level annotation with the event schema and ontology of entities and events from protest research in the social sciences. The dataset uses newswire reports from the English Gigaword corpus. The token-level annotation is inspired by annotation standards for event extraction, in particular that of the Automated Content Extraction 2005 corpus (Walker et al., 2006). Domain experts perform the entire annotation task. We report competitive intercoder agreement results.
