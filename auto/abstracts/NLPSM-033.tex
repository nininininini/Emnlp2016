This paper investigates the problem of identifying participants in online discussions whose contribution can be considered sensible. Sensibleness of a participant can be indicative of the influence a participant may have on the course/outcome of the discussion, as well as other participants in terms of persuading them towards his/her stance. The proposed sensibleness model uses features based on participants' contribution and the discussion domain to achieve an F1-score of 0.89 \\& 0.78 for Wikipedia: Articles for Deletion and 4forums.com discussions respectively.
