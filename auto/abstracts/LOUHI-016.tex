Automated citation analysis (ACA) can be important for many applications including author ranking and literature based information retrieval, extraction, summarization and question answering. In this study, we developed a new compositional attention network (CAN) model to integrate local and global attention representations with a hierarchical attention mechanism. Training on a new benchmark corpus we built, our evaluation shows that the CAN model performs consistently well on both citation classification and sentiment analysis tasks.
