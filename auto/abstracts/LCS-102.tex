Language identification systems suffer when working with short texts or in domains with unconventional spelling, such as Twitter or other social media. These challenges are explored in a shared task for Language Identification in Code-Switched Data (LICS 2016). We apply a hierarchical neural model to this task, learning character and contextualized word-level representations to make word-level language predictions. This approach performs well on both the 2014 and 2016 versions of the shared task.
