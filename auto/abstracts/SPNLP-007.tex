We propose a multi-task learning objective for training joint structured prediction models when no jointly annotated data is available. We use conditional random fields as the joint predictive model and train their parameters by optimizing the marginal likelihood of all available annotations, with additional posterior constraints on the distributions of the latent variables imposed to enforce agreement. Experiments on named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging show that the proposed model outperforms independent task estimation, and the posterior constraints provide a useful mechanism for incorporating domain-specific knowledge.
