Verbal comprehension questions appear very frequently in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the understanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and the analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be solved automatically by the deep learning technologies for text data. We found that the task was quite challenging, and simply applying existing technologies like word embedding could not achieve a good performance, due to the multiple senses of words and the complex relations among words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework to automatically solve the verbal IQ questions by leveraging improved word embedding by jointly considering the multi-sense nature of words and the relational information among words. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can not only outperform existing methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average performance of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers involved in the study.
