This paper illustrates a proposal for the development of an annotation scheme and a corpus for storyline extraction and evaluation from large collections of documents clustered around a topic. The scheme extends existing annotation efforts for event coreference and temporal processing, introducing additional layers and addressing shortcomings. We also show how a storyline can be derived from the annotated data.
