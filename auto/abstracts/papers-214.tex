We combine supervised and unsupervised methods to ensemble systems for two popular Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks, Cold Start Slot Filling (CSSF) and Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (TEDL). We demonstrate that it outperforms the best system for both tasks in the 2015 competition, several ensembling baselines, as well as a state-of-the-art stacking approach. The success of our technique on two different and challenging problems demonstrates the power and generality of our combined approach to ensembling.
