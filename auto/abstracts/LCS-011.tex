We present SAWT, a web-based tool for the annotation of token sequences with an arbitrary set of labels. The key property of the tool is simplicity and ease of use for both annotators and administrators. SAWT runs in any modern browser, including browsers on mobile devices, and only has minimal server-side requirements.
