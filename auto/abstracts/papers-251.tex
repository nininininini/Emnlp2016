In this paper, we utilize distributed word representations (i.e., word embeddings) to analyse the representation of semantics in brain activity. The brain activity data were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when subjects were viewing words. First, we analysed the functional selectivity of different cortex areas by calculating the correlations between neural responses and several types of word representations, including skip-gram word embeddings, visual semantic vectors, and primary visual features. The results demonstrated consistency with existing neuroscientific knowledge. Second, we utilized behavioural data as the semantic ground truth to measure their relevance with brain activity. A method to estimate word embeddings under the constraints of brain activity similarities is further proposed based on the semantic word embedding (SWE) model. The experimental results show that the brain activity data are significantly correlated with the behavioural data of human judgements on semantic similarity. The correlations between the estimated word embeddings and the semantic ground truth can be effectively improved after integrating the brain activity data for learning, which implies that semantic patterns in neural representations may exist that have not been fully captured by state-of-the-art word embeddings derived from text corpora.
