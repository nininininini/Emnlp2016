We present a methodology based on topic modeling that can be used to identify and quantify sociolinguistic differences between groups of people, and describe a regression method that can be used to disentangle the influences of different attributes of the people in the group (e.g., culture, gender, age). As an example, we explore the concept of personal values, and present a cross-cultural analysis of value-behavior relationships spanning writers from the United States and India.
