We recast syntactic parsing as a language modeling problem and use recent advances in neural network language modeling to achieve a new state of the art for constituency Penn Treebank parsing --- 93.8 F1 on section 23, using 2-21 as training, 24 as development, plus tri-training. When trees are converted to Stanford dependencies, UAS and LAS are 95.9\% and 94.1\%.
